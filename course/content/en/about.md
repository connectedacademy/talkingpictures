**“Talking Pictures”** is a connected conversation about photography in the 21st century. The format and the platform are designed to enable the participant to be a part of a global conversation informed by an international range of perspectives and joined live, by the same photographic experts who feature in the content. Participants are invited to create, to share and to feedback on each other’s photographic responses.
 
Each class contains a montage of interviews with **photographers**, a **subjects** and **people who represent the audience**. Subject experts also provide historical and/or thematic context. These pieces are designed to help us address five key questions, namely:
 
- What are you saying?
- Who are you saying it to?
- How are you saying it?
- Why should they believe you?
- And finally, what do you want them to do as a result?
 
Traditional storytelling themes such as Evidence, Interpretation, Fiction, Fact, Narrative and Impact also emerge are discussed throughout.
 
> Submission of photographic work must be in the Four Corners format. Four Corners is an authoring and context tool first envisaged by ex-NY Times Photo Editor, Fred Ritchin. It enables the photographer to furnish an image with extra contextual information, related frames, links, copyright information and their code of ethics.
