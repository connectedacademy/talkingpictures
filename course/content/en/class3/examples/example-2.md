Media access to the Gulf War was heavily limited by Pentagon restrictions. Initially, Turnley was sent into the field with a pool of journalists accompanied by a public affairs officer who enforced these restrictions. As a result, he was not allowed to photograph any war casualties. Eventually, he managed to follow a medical unit without a public affairs officer attached to it. On 27 February, via this unit, he joined the helicopter evacuation team sent to the Euphrates River Valley to pick up fallen and wounded soldiers, including Kozakiewicz, Tsangarakis and Alaniz. Turnley made his award-winning photo moments after Kozakiewicz was given Alaniz’s dog tags. He had asked the soldiers’ permission to take the image. Turnley knew the photograph was good and wanted to get it to his editors as soon as possible. Finding that that image was being held by the military and delayed from reaching the wire, he convinced the lieutenant in charge to release the film. Kozakiewicz was in the hospital when the photo was published in newspapers nationwide. Initially, the US military told Alaniz’s family that he had lost his life driving over a landmine. It was months before they found out the truth.","author":"David Turnley","publication":"Detroit Free Press / Black Star","publicationUrl":"https://www.worldpressphoto.org/collection/photo/1992/world-press-photo-year/david-turnley","date":"27-02-1991"},"creativeCommons":{"credit":"David Turnley","year":"1991","copyright":"All rights reserved","codeOfEthics":"Photojournalist","description":"While being evacuated to a hospital by helicopter, wounded US Sgt. Ken Kozakiewicz gives vent to his grief as he learns that the body bag next to wounded Cpl. Michael Tsangarakis contains the remains of his friend Andy Alaniz. On the last day of the Gulf War, 'friendly fire' claimed Alaniz's life and injured Kozakiewicz and Tsangarakis in the Euphrates Valley, Iraq. \n\nKozakiewicz, Tsangarakis and Alaniz were part of the extremely well-armed US 24th Infantry Division. They were exhausted, having been on the move almost continuously for the last 63 hours, crossing from Kuwait into Iraq towards the Euphrates River Valley. Kozakiewicz, Alaniz and Tsangarakis were in different Bradley military vehicles approaching the airfield in order to sweep the area. A US tank unit, meant to protect them, instead mistook their group of vehicles for the enemy and fired between six and 18 rounds of depleted-uranium, hitting three vehicles. Tsangarakis lost consciousness and suffered burns to the face when his Bradley was hit, while the explosion broke Kozakiewicz’s left hand. Alaniz was killed while driving his Bradley to aid Kozakiewicz’s damaged vehicle."}}
