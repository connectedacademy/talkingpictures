The six-mile long valley of harsh mountainous terrain provided an abundance of hiding places suited to insurgent guerilla training and fighting. US soldiers were fighting regional warlords, timber merchants and local Taliban. Nearly three-quarters of all bombs dropped by NATO forces in Afghanistan were dropped on and around the valley. Though US forces were armed with better weapons, real success depended on the civilian population denying support to insurgent fighters in the area. Restrepo was a remote, sandbagged outpost in the Korengal Valley, about 30 meters long and 10 meters wide, with a bunker at one end. Named after a platoon medic killed in action, Restrepo was notorious as one of the most dangerous postings in the US military. The 15-man outpost had been built by hand by the Second Platoon, Battle Company of the Second Battalion of the US 503rd Infantry Regiment to root out insurgents hiding deep in the mountains. Within five-and-a-half months of Battle Company’s deployment, there were 450 separate firefights, with a record of 14 in a single day. The World Press Photo of the Year was made at the end of a heavy day of fighting. Second Platoon had already had two engagements with enemies and had received news that a supply of grenades and suicide vests had come into the valley. They were afraid the enemy could be as close as 100 meters of the base and might overrun them at any time. A quarter of Specialist Brandon Olson’s unit was dead or wounded. Tim Hetherington was working in the Korengal Valley on assignment for Vanity Fair and ABC Nightline with writer Sebatian Junger. Hetherington was embedded with the US military, but the outpost was far removed from the direct control of the Public Information Offices in Bagram and Jalalabad. It was his first US military embed. Between the two of them, Hetherington and Junger made 10 trips to Restrepo. In total Hetherington spent five months with the platoon, gaining an incredible intimacy and trust with the soldiers, who accepted the journalists and essentially forgot they were there. As Hetherington spent more time in the dangerous outpost, he became less interested in the combat and more and more interested in the men themselves and the emotional realities of how combat affected them. As he often explained, through his work, he was interested to humanize the war machine. The duration and depth of his embed enabled Hetherington to show US audiences a side to the war that most had not been exposed to.","author":"Tim Hetherington","publication":"Vanity Fair","publicationUrl":"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2008/01/afghanistan200801","date":"16-09-2007"},"creativeCommons":{"credit":"Tim Hetherington","year":"2007","copyright":"All rights reserved","codeOfEthics":"Photojournalist","description":"Korengal Valley, Afghanistan.
