00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:02,840
Hello, I'm Jonathan Worth and as well as
being a freelance photographer

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:07,160
I'm also a Senior Researcher at Newcastle
University's Open Lab in the UK.

3
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:11,260
The interviews you're about to hear are part of a series that along with the web platform

4
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:14,360
and connected classes, seeks to create a space for a more

5
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:16,501
critical engagement with visual storytelling.

6
00:00:16,501 --> 00:00:18,869
The audio montage is of several separate interviews

7
00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:21,810
of people variously representing the perspectives of the

8
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:24,420
photographer, their subject and the audience.

9
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:30,200
Our starting point today is "Fiction" as we reflect on the many storytelling devices at our disposal.

10
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:34,120
The photographer for this session unfortunately couldn't be with us.

11
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:38,240
Tim Hetherington died alongside fellow photographer Chris Hondros whilst they

12
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:41,700
were covering the conflict in Misrata,
Libya in 2011.

13
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:45,700
If you don't already know Sleeping Soldiers or Tim's Diary pieces,

14
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:51,180
then you might be familiar with the Sundance winning documentary film Restrepo which Tim co-produced

15
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:55,260
and co-directed with Sebastian Junger. Stephen Mayes knew Tim well, having first

16
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,820
reviewed his portfolio when Tim was a student.

17
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,820
He agreed to talk about his work in this interview.

18
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:04,100
Stephens own career has spanned the full gamut of photography.

19
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:08,980
From news to stock, fine art, and fashion, both as a maker and as a manager.

20
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:12,299
He is the director of the Tim Hetherington Trust, as well as writing

21
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:15,979
and commenting widely on both the
industry and the practice of photography.

22
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,520
Mexico City based photographer Dominic Bracco, who we'll also hear from,

23
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:24,659
was awarded the 2016 Tim Hetherington Visionary Award, and he talks to us about how,

24
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:30,620
using fiction as a storytelling device enables him to both protect his subjects and himself.

25
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,900
Susie Linfield is professor of criticism at New York University,

26
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,470
and although she only features briefly in here, there is a full conversation between her and Stephen

27
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:40,840
in the extended playlist.

28
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:44,720
Likewise there's also a deeper dive interview with the gay rights activist

29
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:47,220
Peter Tatchell who reflects on a lifetime of being the

30
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:51,479
subject of media stories that range from him being vilified to being described as

31
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,400
a national treasure.

32
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,420
[Jonathan] Stephen

33
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,740
[Stephen] I think what's happening at the moment is a

34
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,060
really interesting turning point in photography and the problem we have is

35
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:03,360
that we are trying to understand what is effectively a new medium, that works in a new way,

36
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:09,240
in the terms of the photography that we understood and knew

37
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,020
in the 20th century and in the first decade of this century.

38
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,880
But it's not. It's a different medium,

39
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,460
and it works a different way and to give you one example of this,

40
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:18,440
I look again at Instagram feed and there's this river of images,

41
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:24,750
this cascade of images which people stress about. [Suzan] The way that many

42
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:28,920
people get many images now, which is through their phones, which is in a very

43
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:35,370
personalized individual way, is part of this whole bubble thing. Each person can

44
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:41,640
sort of create their own world and their own reality. I'm not on like Instagram or

45
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:48,510
any of those things but my students are and I see that they just get this flood

46
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:54,570
of images all day that are totally deracinated. I mean some of them are just,

47
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:59,490
you know, their friends and their dogs and their meals but I assume that

48
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:03,570
they're also getting you know news images and different things and I don't

49
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:10,190
know how they make sense of any of that or if they do because I feel it's so

50
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:15,630
separated from context. And I'm not, you know, going back to the nostalgic days

51
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:23,610
when the whole country watched Walter Cronkite, but I do wonder if there is a

52
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:31,890
connection between that kind of individualism and the really intense and

53
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:37,470
dangerous fragmentation of the population now. And the ability that

54
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:45,150
people have to just completely x-out any news that they don't like or they don't

55
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:50,250
believe or they're not interested in. And I wonder if there's a connection between

56
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:55,019
those things.  [Stephen ] Traditionally, we have put a lot of our trust in the title of

57
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:59,580
of the magazine or the newspaper, and it increasingly was happening these days.

58
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:04,040
If the magazines and newspapers are falling into a different roles, social media is

59
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,560
picking up, we have people finding all sorts of ways of acquiring information

60
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:10,080
out, beyond their traditional channels. The integrity is moving on to the

61
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,940
journalists themselves personally, so that as a photographer, people have to

62
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:19,560
really pick up ownership of that story. It's no longer possible to hide behind

63
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:23,190
the, the editor and the title that you're working for, you have to stand up and

64
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:26,340
take that responsibility because you will be visible. In a world that's too

65
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:29,880
full of information, we, we don't properly understand the

66
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:33,630
most valuable thing is integrity, is belief in the author. You have to be

67
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:36,570
credible in a world where there's too much information that we don't

68
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:40,950
understand. It is a highly valuable position. People who have traditionally worked in

69
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:44,460
photography consider each and every picture to be precious, they have a place

70
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:48,750
in the value and need to be archived, indexed, understood et cetera et cetera.

71
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:54,270
And this doesn't really apply anymore, that people read pictures very very

72
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:58,050
quickly and they are reading from the code, they're not they're not just

73
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:01,590
looking at the content of the picture, they're looking at the, the, the

74
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:05,040
metaphorical meaning of it. So when people photograph a picture of their,

75
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:09,450
their meal and they put it on Instagram, you know a lot of professional

76
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:13,200
photographers get very dismissive of it, oh just photographing a meal, but the point is

77
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:17,160
that nobody specifically wants you to know that they have peas and carrots for

78
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:21,480
lunch, they want you to understand the circumstances they were in, and the food

79
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:25,020
becomes a terrific metaphor for where you are. So you know food becomes a code

80
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:30,720
for where I am, the access to nutrients, the social position I'm in. Usually, when

81
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,570
you're traveling at an airport, you know, food looks very different than if you're

82
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:37,800
at a birthday party. You know food becomes a metaphorical representation, it

83
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:43,110
becomes a coded encounter with who you are and who is your place in society.

84
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:46,920
It becomes actually very powerful. So far from being banal, I see pictures of food

85
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:51,560
as actually been very expressive, they are a metaphorical encoded

86
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:55,680
representation of who I am, how I relate to my friends, what I want

87
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,010
them to know about me and it becomes actually a very rich form of

88
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:06,480
communication. And more than communication, it's, it's a sharing, so you

89
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:10,320
know, communication suggests, I just sending out, I want you to note I'm

90
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,800
having lunch, end of story. It's not, it's not the end of the story,

91
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,260
you're looking for feedback at the same time, which social media does so

92
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:20,010
brilliantly. So you, you, you put out the message 'here I am, having lunch, I'm in an

93
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:23,520
airport' and people write back and they say 'cool where you going?' you know or

94
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,550
'I was on my way to Istanbul just last year and I was at the same restaurant'.

95
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:30,870
People share the experience, in all sorts of ways, they share it with their friends,

96
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:35,400
they pass it on, they report back to the person who posted the message. So the, the

97
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,729
photograph, far from being a document of memory, becomes

98
00:06:38,729 --> 00:06:44,699
an actual element in current experience. So you know the photograph itself is the

99
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:49,139
experience, not the meal, curiously. But for everyone who receives the picture is

100
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:53,430
the photograph which is current and that's their, their, what we all used in

101
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:57,779
fact, in commentary and sharing with our friends. So you know the photograph

102
00:06:57,779 --> 00:07:01,919
itself becomes part of the current experience, it's not documenting the

103
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:06,180
current experience, it is the current experience. And that puts the picture in

104
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:11,580
a very very different place, and looking a little bit beyond that, what you then

105
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:17,399
realize that, you know, every current experience soon turns into a memory, soon

106
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:23,580
turns into a blur, is soon forgotten and we're on to the next thing. But what's

107
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:27,509
significant is that we, we have learnt something from that and what we learned

108
00:07:27,509 --> 00:07:33,449
stays with us. We learned that our friend travel to Istanbul through their picture

109
00:07:33,449 --> 00:07:37,169
of the meal and we may forget what exactly the meal was but we remember

110
00:07:37,169 --> 00:07:40,319
that our friend went to Istanbul or they went somewhere where was it oh yes

111
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,370
Istanbul, you know we can work backwards through that. So we take knowledge, we

112
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:49,620
take, you know, from the experience of sharing these imagery, we accumulate

113
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:54,360
knowledge and even though the picture itself becomes ignorable, it has enlarged us,

114
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:58,889
it stays with us, as you listen to this, you probably won't remember the exact

115
00:07:58,889 --> 00:08:02,430
words that I'm using, but I hope you'll take some of the meaning with you. And

116
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:06,029
that's really the point, that's very much where we are with photography, is that

117
00:08:06,029 --> 00:08:10,020
it's not to worry about each individual word, each individual image, we don't need

118
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:12,360
to do that. What we need to do is listen to the

119
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:16,770
meaning, take the meaning onboard, make it ours and move on. And that's I think,

120
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:21,209
it takes photography to a much richer place. It doesn't abandon the evidential

121
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:25,709
place that had before, the formation of record, you know the eyewitness roles

122
00:08:25,709 --> 00:08:29,039
that, you know, the photograph had. It still has those values, it can

123
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:33,329
still be applied but, but, now it has this additional role which is richer,

124
00:08:33,329 --> 00:08:38,669
more fluid, allows for joined-up communication not just statements, it's a

125
00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:41,990
tremendous place to be with imagery.

126
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:47,899
What Instagram is doing is, it is effectively inverting all the

127
00:08:47,899 --> 00:08:53,570
expectations of the image so, in Everyday Africa for example, there is a, a famously an

128
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:58,850
example of a child playing in a pool of muddy water in Africa and the, the

129
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:03,529
Instagram responses of that were of pity and concern about the poverty of this

130
00:09:03,529 --> 00:09:08,149
child and the circumstances she was growing up in. What we then realized is,

131
00:09:08,149 --> 00:09:12,589
it becomes an unrealistic burden on that child to represent the circumstances of

132
00:09:12,589 --> 00:09:16,700
a continent but that's, that's where we've come to with photojournalism, that

133
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:20,450
we use these these codes which are really valuable, but they can also

134
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:24,770
restrict our understanding, that you know not everything is a code, sometimes it is

135
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:29,930
actually a representation. And what is happening more with this river of images

136
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:34,610
through Instagram is much more about representations, about little details of

137
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:42,020
life, which individually have very little import, you know, the woman hanging out

138
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:47,329
laundry, somebody standing in line at the bank for get some cash, these are in a

139
00:09:47,329 --> 00:09:51,320
sense particularly interesting things but what happens is because it's a

140
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:54,579
stream they're not individual statements, they're part of a stream that

141
00:09:54,579 --> 00:10:00,560
collectively we are listening to, we are watching a conversation about Africa.

142
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,790
You know all these incidental details turn out to be incredibly important and the

143
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:08,390
key here is that it moves the responsibility for understanding from

144
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:12,350
the photographer, it moves onto the viewer, you know, we are in a position now

145
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:15,950
where we have to look at what we're seeing, think about it and understand it.

146
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:20,510
And this is quite the opposite of photojournalism, where the role of

147
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:23,990
photojournalist is to exclude all that different, different information

148
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:28,490
and to focus only on the subject in-hand. The news photographer, the newspaper

149
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:32,329
photographer or magazine photographer looks at the all the chaos of the world

150
00:10:32,329 --> 00:10:35,600
and they try to simplify it down to the core elements of a story they're

151
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:41,089
covering, so you're covering famine, you eliminate all the pictures of shopping

152
00:10:41,089 --> 00:10:44,720
around you, because people run shops and have markets and you know even in a

153
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,680
famine area, these daily life happens and all you do is focus on

154
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:52,340
famine. You distract me, you exclude all the distracting information.

155
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:58,910
The notion of the photograph as a as a transient, transient experience if you

156
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:03,050
like, actually works very well for the documentary photographer and that,

157
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:06,890
although if you think traditionally of, in terms of supplying a magazine

158
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:10,970
creating a cover story all that kind of stuff, you know Instagram can be very

159
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:14,450
threatening. If instead of that you embrace the Instagram way of thinking,

160
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:19,880
you can go to a lot of very interesting places beyond Instagram, so you can turn

161
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:25,190
the picture into an experiential process which engages the imagination as much as

162
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:31,550
it tells about the facts of the situation. [Suzan] I think in this time, you're

163
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:39,860
right that I think people, journalists, photographers, activists, citizens, we

164
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:44,029
really need to think about new ways of communication and new ways of

165
00:11:44,029 --> 00:11:47,360
storytelling. Not just new ways of reaching people but new ways of

166
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:53,120
understanding people's emotional worlds [Stephen] I think here of Tim Hetherington for a

167
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:58,280
number of reasons. One is that Tim in the last few years of his life started

168
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:01,700
talking about the image bank, he is talking literally about with the bank of

169
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:06,440
images that we hold in our head and the more images we see of the world, the

170
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:11,960
easier it becomes to reference the codes, you know, included in today's

171
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:15,380
picture that you're looking at. So Tim referred very much to the image bank as

172
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:19,130
being a very inclusive thing, about growing wisdoms, about accumulating

173
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:23,780
knowledge, the bank of images that we've always seen, witnessed, you shared

174
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:28,820
and have understood becomes a tool to
more rapid and more effective

175
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:32,930
communication moving forward. So, for example, if we think about sleeping

176
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:38,690
soldiers, Tim at a certain point, when he was in Afghanistan, he, he started

177
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:43,580
photographing soldiers asleep and this was in the Korengal Valley which, at that

178
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:49,550
time, had more ordnance, had more bombs and, you, know explosives loaded into it

179
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:54,200
than any other place in Afghanistan that year, a highly, highly violent part of the

180
00:12:54,200 --> 00:13:00,350
world. And Tim is photographing soldiers asleep, how bizarre. But of course, there's,

181
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:05,600
there's absolutely a theory behind this and it really works, at very

182
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,920
visceral level, you look at those pictures of men asleep,

183
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:12,710
there, there are no guns, they're not wearing the uniforms, some of them

184
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:16,400
completely naked, but you know that there are soldiers in Afghanistan because we

185
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:20,390
have that context and immediately being to think, why are we looking at this?

186
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:25,280
And immediately you move into a kind of a metaphorical realm and what, what you

187
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:30,080
realize at a certain point is that Tim is not using a reportage here, it's not

188
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:33,170
important that at, you know, five o'clock on the Saturday

189
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:37,670
2008 the soldier was asleep, it's not documentary in that sense. It's moving

190
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:42,440
you more into a place of meditation and it's about, yes this soldier is in

191
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,590
Afghanistan, he is sleeping, and immediately then you moved thoughts

192
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:50,630
about vulnerability. But here's the aggressor who is vulnerable, you deal

193
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:53,960
with these contradictions, so what is that? He's a man, he's a man who was both

194
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:58,250
vulnerable, this is a picture of a man who might, as he might have been seen by

195
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:03,200
his mother, by his lover, completely other context. But he's in conflict, and we

196
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:06,800
begin to think about the role of men in conflict, that one can be vulnerable and

197
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,680
aggressive at the same time. Obviously there's a metaphor between sleep and

198
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,160
death, which has been you know a staple of literature for for hundreds of years,

199
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:18,250
it's that notion is, is what we bring to it, is what we create around that picture,

200
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:23,450
which is not factually depicted in the photograph, which becomes so interesting.

201
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:27,500
Now, if it's not factually the picture than the photograph and we're imposing

202
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:32,030
our meaning on it, is that fiction? It is a fact that the soldier is asleep, but

203
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:36,740
what we bring to it is so much richer, from our experience we are weaving in

204
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:42,500
meaning, we are weaving in significance and that's not really documentary, it's

205
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,710
really hard to think of those pictures as documentary, as in recording of

206
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:51,530
facts, it doesn't make it fiction but at the same time it's using stories that we

207
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:56,330
make up, it's a very interesting area to be in and it allows for a rich, rich

208
00:14:56,330 --> 00:15:01,820
interpretation of the world. The Tim Hetherington trust, one of the

209
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:05,300
core difficulties we have to deal with is, we don't know what Tim would be

210
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:08,840
thinking at this point and we have no interest in speculating, we we can't do

211
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:12,260
that we shouldn't do that, but what we can do is, we can we can look for people

212
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:17,480
who are bringing similar creativity in, in their thinking to documentary work.

213
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:22,970
And this is what we do with our annual award, and in 2016 the visionary award

214
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:30,460
was won by Dominic Bracco. [Dominic] So I'm primarily a documentary photographer,

215
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:35,980
originally from South Texas and that's actually what The Backs of Men project is

216
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:41,180
about, is looking at this region that I grew up in and looking at issues of

217
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:48,650
migration and sort of the the day-to-day things that we encounter being from that

218
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:54,320
region. And then in the last seven years, I've lived in Mexico, right now I'm based

219
00:15:54,320 --> 00:16:00,950
in Mexico City and I've covered cartel violence and human trafficking issues

220
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:06,500
here in the region and also in Central America. After some time of covering

221
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:11,030
those topics as a kind of a strictly photojournalist, documentary photographer,

222
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:17,780
I've started to get frustrated by the limitations of what I was doing, mostly

223
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:25,450
because before I spent a lot of time on one particular project, like, for example,

224
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:29,570
each of these things that I've done I've spent many many years like digging in

225
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:34,340
and photographing the same people, and I just didn't feel like enough to come

226
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:39,380
home with a set of 30 select images or whatever to represent what I had spent

227
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:44,510
multiple years on. I guess I just was questioning how I could do a better

228
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:48,890
justice to this story and I felt like it was always right in front of me I mean,

229
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:52,670
I studied literature in college, specifically I studied a lot of a

230
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:56,600
Mexican literature and I felt like Mexican literature actually taught me a

231
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:02,060
lot more cultural aspects of Mexico for example then, then reading any history

232
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:07,910
book or journalism piece. I've always tried to be like an intimate

233
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:11,450
photographer and I've always felt like the best way of

234
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:17,120
being true to my subjects or the people that I encountered was to try to become

235
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:21,290
very close to them. Which also poses like all kinds of issues because then as you

236
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:25,790
get deeper, you know these people become friends and those relationships change

237
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:30,830
and your objectivity changes and there's all kinds of like not real ideas about

238
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:34,160
the way journalism is supposed to work in the field. And when you're doing

239
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,840
projects that hopefully are more profound or deeper, you're gonna run into

240
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:43,700
all of these ethical quote-unquote ethical issues and that was kind of one

241
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:47,780
of the reasons I'd like to work with fiction is that you just don't have all

242
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:54,020
that shit to deal with. In a way, because you're not tied down by these rules that

243
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:58,130
we've designed for ourselves, quite frankly in a market, in a time that was

244
00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:02,690
very different than we're living in now, you're almost able to tell a truer story

245
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:07,580
in a kind of weird way. You get into some tricky territory here because it's also

246
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:11,150
not to say that they're not worth telling, right, because those stories

247
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:14,630
are worth telling and there are obviously conflicts around the world and

248
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:17,780
there's these like darker sides of humanity that are very important and

249
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:21,980
it's always like how do you tell those and have representation and then how

250
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:25,700
does that representation fair? And the way I dealt with that previously was

251
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:28,520
just should become very close to the subjects that I photographed and like

252
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:32,020
sticking around for a long time and trying not to do like the quote-unquote

253
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:36,710
parachute journalism. But then you're also confronted with this issue once you

254
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:40,430
spend you know multiple years photographing the same folks over and

255
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:44,090
over again, it's like you have like a wealth of knowledge and information that

256
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:48,740
you just can't distill into a tiny little photo essay on a slideshow.

257
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:57,200
When you're doing these stories, people trust you and and you trust them and that's a

258
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,520
big responsibility, I mean, I think that, for example, if you're talking to

259
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:05,750
somebody who has committed a crime and they're being very open with you about

260
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:09,110
it and they might not necessarily understand where the story is going to be

261
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:13,880
published or run, or whatever, it can be a difficult ethical conundrum, right,

262
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:17,420
because you could get this person kill, you could get this person arrested,

263
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:21,170
maybe the circumstances of the crime that they committed are very grey and

264
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:25,510
it's not such an easy thing. And that's actually a perfect example of a place

265
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:31,960
where fiction gives you, creates latitude. Another good example is violence against

266
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:36,040
women, kidnapping and killing of women. And this is a phenomenon that's been

267
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:40,510
going on in what has been famous for it since the 90s and it's been part of the

268
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:44,350
sort of pop narrative of what is, but there was a lot of questions about what

269
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:48,880
actually happened to a lot of these girls and I covered it one of the first

270
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:54,700
open court hearings where they had just implemented this new oral testimony into

271
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:59,560
the Mexican court system in Chihuahua, it was the first state to do it. So I went

272
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:08,680
to a lot of these hearings and listened to the testimony of these folks who did

273
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:13,750
the investigation, I was able to tie in some of the details about what happened

274
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:19,390
to these girls into the fiction story of a character that I invented, based on

275
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:23,620
reality, you know, there's you know where they went, what they ate, how long they

276
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:27,190
spent, bare what happened to them afterwards, the fact that they were in

277
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:31,360
hotels or whatever. These sort of details that I got as a journalist, you know,

278
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:36,070
listening to this but then to tell a story of a person and try, to try to make

279
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:42,040
that human. [Stephen] He also, in his photography, began introducing peripheral elements,

280
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:46,210
little details about personal lives, which place these people as individuals,

281
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:52,390
and from that position allows the viewer to really identify in extraordinary ways.

282
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:56,800
It's one of the strange contradictions, is that the more specific you make a

283
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:00,970
photograph, the more people understand it. And that the problem is that if you try

284
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:05,650
to, if you try to create a generic general view of something, nobody

285
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:09,400
recognizes it, cannot, none of us none of us is generic, you know, we all have live,

286
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:14,020
we all live specific lives and we don't recognize the generic because it doesn't

287
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:18,280
exist in our lives, what we do recognize is the detail and, you know, I recognized

288
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:22,390
the place of detail in people's lives and so the more specific you become, and

289
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:27,560
the more details you include, in point of fact, the more believable the, the story becomes.

290
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:32,220
This sounds kind of contradictory because we expect more detail would

291
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:36,010
separate people but it does quite the opposite, that brings us in and it gives

292
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:39,220
us a point of reference we then allows us to fill in the rest of

293
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:43,120
the story. [Dominic ] One of the most privileged things that we have as journalists,

294
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,510
working in the field, is that we get to know the world from lots of different

295
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:54,340
perspectives and understand people in a way that I don't think the average

296
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:58,480
person on the street really gets to feel, because they just don't have that many

297
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:04,809
personal interactions with people from different classes, races, societies than

298
00:22:04,809 --> 00:22:09,580
maybe a journalist does. Which is cool about fiction is that you can kind of go after

299
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:16,300
everyone equally, you can throw in the sort of sexism, machismo and the

300
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:20,440
racial slurs that people use and you can also like, try to create a character that

301
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:23,920
people like, that uses all those things and then all of a sudden you just feel

302
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:28,360
like a very confused and, I find that great uncomfortable space to be like a

303
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:34,450
really fun way to start conversations about culture. The drawback is obvious

304
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:41,290
and that you can create
misunderstandings or you run the risk of

305
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:46,210
misrepresenting something but I think that you run that same risk as a

306
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:50,290
journalist. It may be even more because like when you're doing it as a

307
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:53,620
journalist, you know, if you're quoting someone I mean everybody who's ever been

308
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:56,950
quoted always feels a little bit like an ass afterwards because they're like, wait

309
00:22:56,950 --> 00:23:01,090
a minute, I felt, you know, we're having a whole conversation that you know brief

310
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:06,730
moment of what I said or, you know, has become the definition of who I am to

311
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:11,530
this writer. But, in fiction, you can interview somebody and then you can use

312
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:16,660
like, the fact that security guards and, and the prison, like, all really like to

313
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:22,360
eat Polish sausages on Sundays or whatever, those are like real like details,

314
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:25,300
I'm not creative enough to make up but that are even better because they're

315
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:30,250
real. Fiction also had ability to obviously blockbuster skill to move a

316
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:34,740
lot of people but it also has an ability to move people in a way that sometimes,

317
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:40,660
sometimes we can't necessarily do as strictly documentary.

318
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:45,880
(Stephen) Interestingly again, another contradiction is that by creating your fictionalized or

319
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:51,340
embellished representation of that person's life in a non documentary form,

320
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:56,340
we can actually generate a greater
trust. (Suzan) Of course there's a big difference

321
00:23:56,340 --> 00:24:01,840
between fiction and untruth. Fiction can be in fact a kind of truth, a very

322
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:06,910
illuminating kind of truth. Fiction is not a form of lying, the Tim

323
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:11,620
Hetherington piece which I found very moving and very powerful, I don't know if

324
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:20,100
I would exactly call that fiction. (Stephen) Abstracting it into a fictional place

325
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:27,159
makes it, it makes it a) real because we can talk about details and things which

326
00:24:27,159 --> 00:24:31,780
going on in all our lives, it makes it safe for the subject and it makes it

327
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:35,470
credible for the the viewer and in all of that there's a number of

328
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:40,000
contradictions but it all needs the same thing which is, through fiction one can

329
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:46,570
create deeper truth. Of course, the, the core here is to display where you're

330
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:51,700
coming from, that to create a fiction and pass that off as fact would be a

331
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:56,350
misrepresentation. But to say I went to
this situation and I understood what's

332
00:24:56,350 --> 00:25:01,120
happening and here's what I saw, here's
what I understood, I I think takes us to

333
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:05,140
a much richer place. And I've talked elsewhere and often about Martha

334
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:10,000
Gellhorn who was working as a journalist in the 1930s, covering the Great

335
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:16,919
Depression and she eventually reported her, her experiences in the dust bowls of

336
00:25:16,919 --> 00:25:21,970
of America during the Depression in the series of short novels. Having read those

337
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:26,710
novels, I now have a deeper understanding of what happened then, then I have had

338
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:30,130
from all the statistics I read, all the history books which tell me the facts of

339
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:34,299
what happened, through Martha Gellhorn I understand why people behave like that,

340
00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:39,250
what pressures were on them, what, what emotional drivers put them in positions

341
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:45,640
or forced them to work in certain ways. And so you know, the fiction can lead to

342
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,980
a greater truth. Gellhorn didn't present those fictions

343
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:51,940
as a newspaper articles, she said these are novels based on my experience.

344
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:56,980
(Suzan) A lot of her journalism reads like short stories because she's employing a lot,

345
00:25:56,980 --> 00:26:04,269
a lot, a lot of fictional techniques; character, interior, monologue,

346
00:26:04,269 --> 00:26:10,850
conversation, I don't think that she was making things up, but they really read

347
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:16,730
like little short stories. (Stephen) And so context is key, and as with Dominic you know here

348
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:20,929
is a stage play, it's not a transcript of conversation, it's my interpretation of

349
00:26:20,929 --> 00:26:25,009
all the conversations I've been part of, all the things I've witnessed, so I think

350
00:26:25,009 --> 00:26:29,570
that you know, declaring your position is fundamental to all of this.

351
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:33,470
It comes back by the way to the notion of, you know, the integrity of the

352
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:36,500
photographer of, you know, the more exposed we are these days, we're no

353
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:41,000
longer able to hide behind other people and other production agencies, you know,

354
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,289
we are representing our version of the world, we have to stand behind that,

355
00:26:45,289 --> 00:26:51,110
therefore identifying ourselves, not only it generates, if you like, market value for who

356
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:57,289
we are, it also generates, you know, documentary value, it, it gives us

357
00:26:57,289 --> 00:27:02,809
credibility as reporters and it's that, that honesty is really core, and one

358
00:27:02,809 --> 00:27:06,950
shouldn't be shy of it, one should embrace it. (Jonathan) This set of interviews set

359
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:10,220
out to address the theme of fiction in storytelling and in doing so, the

360
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:14,059
participants really dug into the nature of photography itself, they're talking

361
00:27:14,059 --> 00:27:17,389
about this thing we refer to as photography as having shifted and

362
00:27:17,389 --> 00:27:22,460
changed. Steven says that this change doesn't negate photography's evidential

363
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:27,259
history, but the flow of Instagram adds an experiential quality, a coded one,

364
00:27:27,259 --> 00:27:32,389
where the message of the image isn't necessarily what it depicts. The language

365
00:27:32,389 --> 00:27:37,429
of Instagram may denote one thing but the connotation is quite another. Just as

366
00:27:37,429 --> 00:27:41,210
when we look at a picture of a heart, we know it denotes an internal organ but

367
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:44,269
the fairly universal connotation is one of love or endearment.

368
00:27:44,269 --> 00:27:49,980
The Instagram food image is not necessarily a nutritional message.

369
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:53,860
Suzie talks of a need to address new and bewildering situations that require new

370
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:57,679
ways of storytelling and we might argue that as Stephen intimates??? they're already

371
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:01,580
here, we already know that the image of food shared is not just a record of our

372
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:06,470
diet. As Steven says social media is a feedback machine that invites engagement.

373
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:10,820
The airport shared lunch is the beginning of a conversation, not the end.

374
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:13,940
For many people this is going to be stating the obvious, of course it's not

375
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:17,419
about food, just like the disappearing selfies of snapchat are not meant as

376
00:28:17,419 --> 00:28:19,470
record what I look like for future posterity.

377
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:24,000
For those people this might feel like a non-issue, which puts me in mind of

378
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,480
something the Canadian philosopher Marshall McLuhan once said: 'We don't know

379
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:32,250
who discovered the water, but we know it wasn't the fish. In other words, one

380
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:37,290
cannot understand wet if one has never been dry. Many people listening to this

381
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:41,100
will not have known a time before digital photography and social media,

382
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:45,050
a time where the published photograph did not invite a response from the audience.

383
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:49,650
But for those who do remember and who are bewildered, McLuhan had another

384
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:52,920
message. He said that anxiety is in great part

385
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:56,730
the result of trying to do today's jobs with yesterday's tools, with

386
00:28:56,730 --> 00:29:00,840
yesterday's concepts. So in this ranging series of interviews and you should

387
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:05,280
investigate the extended individual recordings, Stephen and Susie begin by

388
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:09,180
discussing the ways the images are experienced through social media, what

389
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:14,060
that means for us as consumers and what that might afford us as producers.

390
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:17,850
Stephen introduces us to the work of Martha Gellhorn, Tim Hetherington

391
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:22,050
and Dominic Bracco who in turn invites us not to be tied down by rules that

392
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:25,800
we've designed for ourselves in a market and time that was very different to the

393
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:31,080
one we're living in now. They show us how consolidating a wealth of factual

394
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:36,450
experience, within fictional narratives was and is a useful and appropriate

395
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:41,010
device for the visual storyteller. Not everyone is going to agree, the use of

396
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:45,240
stock photographs in news is a related issue and it's a polarizing one, but

397
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:48,930
there are strong arguments on either side. The deep dive interview with Guy

398
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:53,130
Martin is particularly pertinent to this session, it builds on some of those

399
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:56,880
themes from a unique perspective coming as it does from someone whose path drew

400
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:01,020
very close to Tim's. Guy set the task for this session and listening to his

401
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:04,860
interview helps us to think about fiction in a more nuanced way. He pushes

402
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:07,740
us to think more deeply about some of the more performative relationships

403
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:12,090
between the photographer and the subject and also to reflect on how the tropes of

404
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:16,350
popular culture could become lenses through which we both perceive and as

405
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:21,120
photographers describe the world. Don't forget to investigate the class notes,

406
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,630
see why particular parts of the conversation are being responded to and

407
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:28,680
by whom, reach out and connect with people and where possible support those

408
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:31,410
who can't get into a roomful of fellow students.

409
00:30:31,410 --> 00:30:36,120
