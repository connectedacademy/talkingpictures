It explores the route through the Balkans and the refugees’ interactions with locals—including the shared suspicion, discomfort, and fear, the latter thanks to a still-present awareness of the war that ravaged these same lands less than two decades ago.\n\nThe countries in this area were largely unprepared for an exodus on such scale. The waves of refugees and migrants paid the price: many struggled to fit on the buses that brought them across the border, losing their family members in the process. Crowds of thousands of people filled vast, once empty fields. They slept in groups in front of overcrowded registration centers. At times, this crises resembled the Biblical Exodus.\n\nThe Balkan route began at the Macedonian border with Greece in the Gevgelija train station; it proceeded onward through registration centers in Serbia, then crossed the Croatian wilds to Slovenia, where the refugees and migrants were escorted by police into Austria. Here they hoped to secure their dreams of a peaceful tomorrow. Today, the policies of open borders have all but shut this route down. But these photos look back at the path taken by some three-quarters of a million people during a year in which tens of millions the world over were forcibly displaced from their homes.","author":"Matic Zorman","publication":"World Press Photo","publicationUrl":"https://www.worldpressphoto.org/collection/photo/2016/people/matic-zorman","date":"October 7, 2015"},"creativeCommons":{"credit":"Matic Zorman","year":"2015","copyright":"All rights reserved","codeOfEthics":"Photojournalist","description":"Refugee children covered in rain capes wait in line to be registered.
