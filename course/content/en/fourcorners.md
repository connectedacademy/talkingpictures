## About Four Corners

Four Corners is an authoring tool for photographers. It enables the reader to see what is happening in the photograph, why the photographer made it and under what conditions.

Ex-New York Times Photo Editor Fred Ritchin, proposed the idea in his book After Photography. He envisaged each corner of an image providing access to extra information; top left would be the frames before and after, top right would be links to further, related information. Bottom left would be the background-story of the image and bottom right would be the photographer’s name, copyright terms and, their code of ethics.

We’re using 4C because it both enables and encourages the reader to interrogate the image in a non-linear way, so less like a book and more like a website. Crucially it also shifts the role of the photographer from being suppliers to publishers, to being a publisher themselves. In doing so it also enables photographers not already associated with a corporate policy or code of ethics, to be explicit and transparent about the way they practice photography.<#NoFilter>. Similarly the choice of copyright options encourage the photographer to consider licensing strategies appropriate to their intentions, from CC-BY (share freely and widely) at one extreme, to © All Rights Reserved (use with my explicit permission only) at the other.
