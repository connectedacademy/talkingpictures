00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:03,780
Hello I'm Jonathan Worth and as well as being a freelance photographer I'm also

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:07,980
a Senior Researcher at Newcastle University's Open Lab in the UK.

3
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:11,340
The interviews you're about to hear are a part of a series that along with the web

4
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:15,660
platform and connected classes seeks to create a space for critical engagement

5
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:19,170
with visual storytelling. The audio montage is of several separate

6
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:22,470
interviews, including a photographer their subject and someone who represents

7
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:27,720
the audience. The photographer is Isadora
Kosofsky and her two subjects are

8
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:32,600
Vincent and Felicia. The audience perspective is provided by Peter DiCampo.

9
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,040
Isadora is a Los Angeles-based photographer, she was also a 2014

10
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:41,260
World Press Photo Joop Swart Masterclass participant. She's received distinctions

11
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:45,000
for her work from Women and Photography International, Prix de la Photographie, Paris

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,840
and the New York Film Festival. Vincent and Felicia are subjects from

13
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:53,940
Isadora's project Vinnie and David 'Life and incarceration of a family'.

14
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:57,540
Peter is one of the cofounders of the Instagram project Everyday Africa,

15
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:02,240
a project that led him to think deeply on how different audiences interpret images.

16
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:07,040
Pete Brooke is our subject specialist and he gives a contextual overview.

17
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,280
Many will know Pete from his days writing for Wired, others will know him from his

18
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:13,770
prison photography project and its collation of the many different forms of

19
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:17,460
image making the related to mass incarceration. The starting point in

20
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:21,479
these interviews was thinking about who we as photographers are talking to,

21
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:25,840
sort of who are intended audiences are and how different audiences might interpret our work.

22
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,480
You'll hear Isadora describes her approach to storytelling, how she

23
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:33,180
searches out her subjects and when she
finds them how she builds and commits to

24
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:37,140
long-term relationships with them. You're also going to hear about how the process

25
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,860
of doing the interviews for this course have affected Isadora, how they've made

26
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:45,000
her reflect on the impact she's had on her subjects. And as we listen, it is worth

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,930
considering how our own approaches to storytelling affect the story itself.

28
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:52,520
We're going to find that context is a recurring theme in this talk and in

29
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:57,020
different guises as we listen to Felicia describes her incomprehension and why

30
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:00,810
anyone would want to see photographs of their lowest moments. We might turn that

31
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:04,110
into a question for ourselves: 'What are the moments where we've considered

32
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:08,340
photographs unnecessary or inappropriate? Are there moments in life where

33
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,840
photography is entirely obsolete and how might that value question change with

34
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,810
context? What are the contextual ingredients

35
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:20,489
required for the mundane to become interesting or of consequence? As in the

36
00:02:20,489 --> 00:02:24,450
case here where Felicia's darkest moments might have a deeper and wider social

37
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:28,709
resonance. Don't forget to use the platform to share your notes and to make

38
00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:32,849
comments on other people's. Listen to the audio in your own time taking time to

39
00:02:32,849 --> 00:02:37,709
pause reflect and interrogate any hot sections in the transcript. Make the most

40
00:02:37,709 --> 00:02:42,209
of the connected classes and build your
network of peers. Isadora:

41
00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:48,060
My name is Isadora Kosofsky, I'm a documentary photographer and I'm

42
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:55,400
speaking to you from my studio apartment in Los Angeles, California.

43
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:02,660
Vinnie and David 'Life and incarceration of a family', a 5-year documentary photo essay that

44
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:10,420
I'm continuing to work on, begins with Vinnie who was 13 when the project began when

45
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:15,689
he was incarcerated for stabbing his mother's assailant and shadows him and

46
00:03:15,689 --> 00:03:22,980
his older brother David then aged 19. The long-term photo essay focuses on the

47
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:30,000
brothers' lives in their family, community and respective incarcerations over five years

48
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:38,519
in Albuquerque, New Mexico. (Vinnie) My name is Vincent, I'm with the project of Vinnie

49
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:45,989
and David. The first time I met Dora I was in recreational time in the youth

50
00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:51,389
detention center and I realized that she was taking photographs of other inmates

51
00:03:51,389 --> 00:03:56,549
that were with me, she asked me if I would like to have an interview with her

52
00:03:56,549 --> 00:04:03,650
and I responded with the answer yes. (Isadora) I was intrigued, I don't think that it was

53
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:09,510
entirely his appearance, there was something striking about how small he

54
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:18,389
was in stature, he was also striking that he was so confident, he evoked a depth

55
00:04:18,389 --> 00:04:23,340
and maturity. I followed him into the unit

56
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:28,840
and he sat down in front of the television screen and he chose to sit

57
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:36,240
across from a number of boys who were sitting on the other side of the room,

58
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:42,780
he sat by himself in an empty row of chairs and I approached him, I sat down next to

59
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:47,140
him and I asked him what are you doing
here?

60
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:53,710
(Vinnie) My mom started getting beat up by a male and I, I defended my mother and the right

61
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:58,020
way I was taught and the right way I knew, I wasn't trying to hurt nobody but

62
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:04,920
unfortunately I had no choice to, so, I got in trouble for defending my mom.

63
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:10,660
(Isadora) He had been arrested for stabbing the man who was assaulting his mother, who he had

64
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:16,630
already witnessed for many years being abused by men, he said that he couldn't

65
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:23,350
take seeing his mother get hurt anymore.
Vinnie began telling me about his

66
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:28,180
relationship with his brother and of course speaking of the love for his

67
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:32,560
mother and his concern for her. (Vinnie) I really didn't know what to think about the

68
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:39,220
camera, when you started taking pictures it was kind of like hmm do I smile or do

69
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:46,040
I not smile? It was one of those. The main thing was, you paid attention.

70
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:49,900
You respected everything I said and you 
listened, you didn't try to interrupt me,

71
00:05:50,400 --> 00:06:00,030
and that matters. (Isadora) Had you ever spoken with a journalist before? (Vinnie) Not once in my life.

72
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:07,410
(Pete Brook) The United States is addicted to incarceration, only recently has the

73
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:11,310
country begun to admit as much. (Jonathan) Prison Photography blog founder Pete Brooke:

74
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:17,460
First, some facts: every year two million youth are arrested in the United States.

75
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:22,920
On any given night there are at least 60,000 children behind bars.

76
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:28,940
Some estimates have it as high as 65,000. With an average cost of $80,000 per year to

77
00:06:28,949 --> 00:06:34,289
lock up a child, the US spends more than five billion dollars annually on

78
00:06:34,289 --> 00:06:39,840
youth detention. In more wealthy states such as California, it can cost up to two

79
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,210
hundred thousand dollars per year to incarcerate a single child.

80
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:49,590
By contrast, spending in the California public school system ranges from seven

81
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:55,740
thousand to eighteen thousand per student per year. Why did the US juvenile

82
00:06:55,740 --> 00:07:02,310
prison system grow so much? Well, throughout the 1980s and 1990s juvenile

83
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:07,080
detention began to mimic the adult system. Juvenile systems built facilities

84
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:12,360
that functioned like adult prisons, incapacitation became the mantra and in

85
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:16,349
such a political climate, rehabilitation for youth was sidelined or suspended

86
00:07:16,349 --> 00:07:20,909
altogether. During an uptick in violent crime in the 80s and 90s there emerged a

87
00:07:20,909 --> 00:07:25,500
hysteria about young criminals, there are brandish super-predators feral

88
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:33,270
teenagers of terrorized society. (Isadora) I saw Vinny and I knew that he was gonna

89
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:38,310
be the subject of a long term project, but I was struck by what he was saying

90
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:44,430
about his brother and how his brother wasn't good but he wasn't bad and he was

91
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:49,979
somebody that he loved and admired. He spoke of his brother as a kind of father

92
00:07:49,979 --> 00:07:56,580
figure and I wanted to know this brother just from hearing about him. I don't think

93
00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:01,500
that you can shoot for an audience particularly when working on a long term

94
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:07,740
series, you have to shoot for the subject and you have to shoot in relation to the

95
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:12,810
curiosity that you have about that subject, because at the end of the day,

96
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:17,740
the person most impacted is gonna be the subject.

97
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:26,340
When I met Vinny I knew that he was somebody that I wanted to know, I wanted to know

98
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:31,230
about him, I wanted to know about his mother, I wanted to know about his

99
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:37,440
brother. It was a curiosity, it was a connection that I felt burning inside of

100
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:44,180
me that I had to pursue. I had been looking for a family that bared the

101
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:50,340
dynamics that I was trying to tell in the juvenile detention facility but I

102
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:56,010
couldn't tell their story within the confines of a carceral setting because

103
00:08:56,010 --> 00:09:01,110
that's setting in and of itself defines the subject. You're not able visually to

104
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:04,950
see the subject anywhere else but in that facility if you're only shooting

105
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:10,680
there and to me that was limiting. Of course the images of time spent in there

106
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:17,790
are fundamental to the story but they're not the entirety of the story. Had I just

107
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:22,170
photographed Vinnie, I would have simplified the story, I would have

108
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:28,670
reduced the story. The fact that the body of work contains multiple narratives

109
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:39,560
allows for multiple conversations from an audience. People are able to relate to

110
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:46,260
the experience of being a brother, a sister a mother and that is what my

111
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:50,790
intention has been from the beginning. I think that people need to see this

112
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:59,850
family as family first, as brothers first and as incarcerated people second.

113
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:07,740
Can you describe the first time that you saw the photograph that I took of you?
 (Vinnie) The first time I had actually seen

114
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:16,700
a photograph of me was in the visitation room with my mother, we were both crying.

115
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:22,020
I couldn't go home with my mother and, and in the experience of that visit

116
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:27,710
that was my first visit with my mom, I really felt that I let my mom down

117
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:34,220
even though she felt she let me down because I couldn't go back to have that

118
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:40,980
peace of mind and my mom that I was there to protect her.  (Isadora) What was it like to have like a document of that moment?

119
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:46,700
It gives me something to look back on the moment of the photo makes me think

120
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:54,410
that from where I was to where I am now I've learned from that. (Peter DiCampo) I mean I think

121
00:10:54,410 --> 00:11:01,010
the responsibility that she feels to the to the subjects in this case is directly

122
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:06,050
tied in to the idea of long form journalism. (Jonathan) Everyday Africa co-founder

123
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:11,840
Peter DiCampo: of sort of responding to or rather protecting their, not

124
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:15,200
protecting but respecting their
vulnerability, respecting the power that

125
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,190
she has in this situation. Some interesting sort of comparison to

126
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:22,160
Everyday Africa, I mean because you know we're, we're we're not dealing with a

127
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:26,300
with a family structure, we're not dealing with any one sort of subject

128
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:31,610
matter, you know, we're we're trying to broaden their perspective, isn't of an

129
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:37,580
entire continent and in that way it is its own form of a long term story. I was

130
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:43,670
really struck by her saying that you don't shoot a long-term project for an

131
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:47,480
audience, you do it you know thinking thinking only of the subject and and of

132
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,560
course I completely understand what she's saying you know, she's, her

133
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:57,050
predominant concern is whether she is treating her subject fairly, whether

134
00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:01,610
she's showing them in a way that is fair
and positive to them. But it's

135
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:06,260
interesting to me because to me her work is so much about what it can teach to an

136
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:11,420
audience, what, what we can learn from it, you know the degree to which humanizing

137
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:18,290
these characters helps us understand more about the system of incarceration

138
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:25,280
as a broader issue. And so presumably perhaps those choices come up in the

139
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:30,530
editing process, once she sort of is able to, you know, have the headspace to say

140
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:34,190
okay now I'm just thinking about how I'm going to present this work and then of

141
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:38,779
course she's choosing the images that, that move the narrative

142
00:12:38,779 --> 00:12:42,860
along but also the images that give us sort of a lot of the most intimate

143
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:48,470
moments, at times the most sort of everyday life moments again all of those

144
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:52,760
things that help us humanize the characters, that help us, you know,

145
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:57,290
identify with them and help us learn who they are and so from that

146
00:12:57,290 --> 00:13:01,520
perspective it seems to be very much
about what can, you know, what can the

147
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:05,300
photographer deliver to the audience, what can the photographer teach the audience.

148
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:10,860
So much of what she's trying to accomplish here is a degree of context,

149
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:15,860
a degree of the why basically, you know why do these things happen, why this

150
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:20,570
particular boy, the social factors that lead up to this, the family factors that

151
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:26,029
lead up to this, you know if you, if you showed incarceration purely as, as people

152
00:13:26,029 --> 00:13:29,390
in prison I mean that's not a, I mean that shows what life and prisoners like

153
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:34,130
or in this case life in a youth facility but, but it doesn't show, it doesn't

154
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:39,080
answer any of our questions of how did we get to this point in a way that long

155
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:44,720
form and, and more in-depth journalism of any genre or any medium can accomplish.

156
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:51,200
And so you know to me it's, it's once you sort of start to think about her

157
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:55,580
motivations and hear from her why she did the body of work and of course she

158
00:13:55,580 --> 00:14:00,290
moved out of what she calls the carceral setting because you have to get into the

159
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:04,730
family life. It draws us into who they are as characters in addition to

160
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:12,410
providing us some of the answers for, you know, what does this all mean, I mean what

161
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:15,860
her work accomplishes is, it's sort of breaking down that barrier of just

162
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:19,130
assuming people in any kind of Correctional Facility must have sort of

163
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:22,520
done something to to get there, right, done something to deserve it and of

164
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:26,990
course once you get into their family life and, and you know the broader

165
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:33,500
situation and once you kind of see them become sort of humanized by, you know,

166
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:37,760
through following her photo essay, it just teaches you that there's so much

167
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,550
more to the situation.

168
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:51,040
(Isadora) When I sat down in Albuquerque New Mexico with Vinny when he was 18 in

169
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:56,440
order to conduct an interview of him about his experience of being the

170
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:03,400
subject of my long-term project, I was able to hear his experience of the

171
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:09,070
project which I have not heard before. I didn't know that they cried when they

172
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:15,250
saw the article, the first article through time. I didn't know that they

173
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:26,050
cried when they would look at the photos that I sent and that has changed the way

174
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:35,460
that I look at my subjects because I feel seen, I feel seen now that I know

175
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:44,140
that the photos and the process have impacted them. (Felicia) My first impression of you

176
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:48,850
honestly was, I thought wow people just aren't that amazing and nice and

177
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:55,540
generous and sweet and just beautiful. When you said it or when I asked why are

178
00:15:55,540 --> 00:16:00,640
you always taking pictures she said that's what I do I'm a photographer and I

179
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:06,339
really fell in love. I am with you, there
was something I always wanted to do and

180
00:16:06,339 --> 00:16:10,839
have a career in because taking pictures was always so like meaningful to me and

181
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:15,690
I got to see you do it and you got to do it for a living and travel and just

182
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:24,760
enjoy it. That first day I met you, you took us from the motel to McDonald's to

183
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:29,520
buy the kids food and we got out at McDonald's you started taking pictures

184
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:33,390
and I just thought,

185
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:38,610
what does she care about us for like what is this what is her real intention?

186
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:49,520
Like and at the same time I was just like man I wish I could do that. (Isadora) What was the experience like of first being photographed and how did it make you feel?

187
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:55,680
(Felicia) Just became kind of natural, have you take pictures of us, I mean even at some of

188
00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:01,440
the worst of the worst baddest times like it was just natural that we'd let

189
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:11,400
you take pictures of us and be there and be a part of the family. (Isadora) Can you describe David's responses when he first saw the photos?

190
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:18,080
(Felicia) He cried. First time he ever saw any of the pictures you took of us and they were the ones of him

191
00:17:18,089 --> 00:17:23,250
and Lily in the park, him walking down the street from my mom's house pushing

192
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:31,560
Lily in the stroller. Ones of me and him
and his mom's crying together in the

193
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:36,660
street, pictures of me at the park being
pregnant with Lily.

194
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:47,320
He cried, we both cried. (Isadora) What was it like for the family to see the article in TIME?

195
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:52,880
(Felicia) Every single one of anybody in the family that saw it when they saw it

196
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:59,450
cried. I mean they were all, you know, loved it and joyful and happy about it

197
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:04,700
but in the beginning the first time that any of us saw it we cried, all of us,

198
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:11,200
the images that you capture and the way you told their story like through pictures

199
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:19,430
was just amazing, like like who does that? This girl, it was it was truly amazing

200
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:23,680
and it deeply touched everybody especially for everybody in the family.

201
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:30,140
It's just so meaningful and sad but yet it brings so much joy at the same time

202
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:35,920
to know that somebody puts so much effort in to tell their story when it

203
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:42,410
was like we were the lowest of the low like who wants to even be around us, see us,

204
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:47,270
let alone care about what we're going through or photographing us at the

205
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:54,010
lowest of the low like and that that's that's deeper there.

206
00:18:55,190 --> 00:19:03,500
(Isadora) I don't, I don't particularly want to
feel seen because it's vulnerable but I

207
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:09,080
know as a photographer that you have to be vulnerable with your subjects in

208
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:13,880
order for them to be vulnerable with you. Not only do they see themselves in the

209
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:20,750
photos, they also see me and I very much overlook the fact that I am even a

210
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:26,120
person sometimes when I'm shooting
because I have to be a kind of welcoming

211
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:32,660
wall, because I have to withstand painful moments and I cannot react, I cannot act

212
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:39,230
in moments that perhaps other people could because I'm in a capacity of being

213
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:45,950
witness, of bearing witness and of using the photographs to create larger change

214
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:51,800
than I would be able to in a moment of reaction in that space with that family.

215
00:19:51,800 --> 00:20:01,490
This family sees me that I am someone in their lives and people listening this

216
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:08,660
may seem odd but in the process that I go through as a photojournalist I try

217
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:14,180
and overlook that I feel that I am invisible and when I showed the photos

218
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:23,870
to Vinnie in 2014 before it went live on time.com, I asked him if the photo essay,

219
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:29,960
the edit, not the photos in general, the edit that was going to be published was

220
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:36,410
true to his experience and he said yes and that's when I knew it was ready to

221
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:41,870
be shown. He said 99% and I said what would give

222
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:51,590
me that 1% authenticity or truthfulness? He said, well, you could never know what I

223
00:20:51,590 --> 00:21:00,080
feel like, so I can't give you a hundred percent, I can only give you 99%. I don't

224
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:06,200
feel that I need Vinnie, David or Felicia and I don't feel that

225
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:12,110
they need me whatsoever. It's a healthy dynamic, it is a complex

226
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:22,789
dynamic between my subjects and I, between that family and my identity as a

227
00:21:22,789 --> 00:21:29,029
photographer. I don't need them and they don't need me but I want them and they

228
00:21:29,029 --> 00:21:38,260
want me which is, I believe, a normal response to a long-term relationship.

229
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:45,799
I know that Vinnie mentioned that he feels that I've somewhat inspired him to have

230
00:21:45,799 --> 00:21:53,630
a healthy life, I don't know if that's entirely true, David said to me, I've

231
00:21:53,630 --> 00:22:04,540
never really liked pictures, pictures don't lie, a photo is evidence.

232
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:11,200
That's something that has stuck with me as I've worked with that family, that I needed

233
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:19,880
to make photos into catalysts for compassion because visual media had been

234
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:27,260
used and is used as a way to incarcerate people, photography is used as a weapon

235
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:34,070
against families like Vinnie and David's family. Do you think that people

236
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:36,610
empathize with you through this photos?

237
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:42,710
(Vinnie) As a matter of fact, the sympathy I have had for some of the

238
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:48,740
photos I got, for example, I got pulled over and a cop ran my name and he

239
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:52,970
and came back to my vehicle he goes: you're on the internet for defending

240
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:55,700
your mom and I didn't know that that was what that was for

241
00:22:55,700 --> 00:23:03,440
and I said yeah, he goes well good job and that brought me confidence. I knew at

242
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:20,320
that point that there, it was no greater than it could get.

243
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:24,100
(Jonathan) One of the participants commented that these conversations between the subject and

244
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:27,260
photographer may be more humanizing than photographs alone.

245
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:30,740
How does listening to Vincent and Felicia affect your reading of the work?

246
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:34,130
Do you think the images are an accurate reflection of the relationships you've

247
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:38,990
heard described? Isadora talks about overlooking her own impact. In the full

248
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:42,650
interview she talks of being a part of the fabric of the moment and that's

249
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:46,970
probably a convenient oversight that most, perhaps all, photographers make to

250
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:52,220
some degree. Isadora says that she shoots for her subjects and her, that her

251
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:55,490
subjects become her friends or by her commitment to the relationship her

252
00:23:55,490 --> 00:24:00,230
friends become her subjects. She says she doesn't shoot for an audience or more

253
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:04,100
accurately that she isn't cognizant of the audience when she's shooting.

254
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:07,540
We shouldn't take away from that, that she isn't mindful of them, I mean, she's not

255
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:11,120
saying that she's photographing in a creative vacuum because she's not.

256
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:15,100
If anything she's hyper aware of the audience, she might not be shooting for

257
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:18,620
an audience but she's certainly editing a vision of the world for one.

258
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:22,790
Isadora says that she couldn't limit her images of Vinnie to a castle setting,

259
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:26,660
that the setting would define the subject and she introduces us to the

260
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:30,380
notion of transcarceral and says that she needed to photograph the mother and

261
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:34,280
the brother in order to make photographs that act as catalysts for empathy,

262
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:38,450
bridges between the subject and the audience. We put in mind of advice that

263
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:42,540
the photographer Lisette Model purportedly gave to a young Diane Arbus.

264
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:47,179
She said that the more specific you are, the more general you'll be. In other

265
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:51,400
words if you want to talk about aging then photograph your grandparents

266
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:54,420
because everyone can relate personally to the notion of a grandparent figure.

267
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:58,220
And each of us will have relatable ties, as Isadora calls them,

268
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:03,740
with the idea of a mother, a brother, a girlfriend a boyfriend, just as we will a

269
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:08,809
warm embrace or a tearful hug, and once on the inside of that emotion once drawn

270
00:25:08,809 --> 00:25:13,640
in she leads us further into the catastrophic loneliness that must come

271
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:17,300
to an isolated incarcerated thirteen-year-old child.

272
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:22,480
There is also a wake-up call in there for us as audience, our impact.

273
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:26,980
Isadora says that she didn't know the family cried when they saw the pictures,  that's

274
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:32,559
a moment we, us an audience, and the subject shared, they saw their lives

275
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:36,940
recontextualized as or photographic equivalent of an out-of-body experience,

276
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:41,240
looking on the story of that time in
their lives but through a third set of

277
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:46,399
eyes. But also for the first time
experiencing those moments without

278
00:25:46,399 --> 00:25:50,779
Isadora in front of them, without the photographer present. Think about that:

279
00:25:50,779 --> 00:25:54,860
Your subject with whom you've built a trust relationship and who's allowed you

280
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:59,419
to make their picture, will be alone in front of an audience come publication.

281
00:25:59,419 --> 00:26:04,090
And on one level, your picture will be a portrait of your relationship with them.

282
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:08,659
Isadora says again in the extended interview that she feels the social

283
00:26:08,659 --> 00:26:12,529
resonance of the work comes with the personal connection she forms with those

284
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:16,520
subjects and as photographers ourselves of differing ages and backgrounds,

285
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:20,140
it will be interesting to know if you think that Isadora's age, relative to her

286
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:24,700
subjects, her gender, her race, if all those things affect this story,

287
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:30,440
I'm asking how important is Isadora? Isadora talks about how her approach to

288
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:34,760
photography negates abandonment and both Vinny and Felicia refer to the fact that

289
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:38,820
she returned, that she did what she said she'd do and how important that was for them.

290
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:41,960
And then Isadora builds on that by reflecting on how documentary

291
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:47,510
photography's relatable ties lessen loneliness for her personally and the

292
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:52,340
subject and the audience too. Perhaps that's that's a part of the currency of

293
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:56,450
this work and this way of working the photographer leverages a loneliness

294
00:26:56,450 --> 00:27:02,240
that is inherent in us all. Simon Norfolks says that for his work, beauty

295
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:06,919
is a seductive tool, he'll draw the audience in with a beautiful image so he

296
00:27:06,919 --> 00:27:09,680
can incite the curiosity about the subject and that's

297
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:14,560
clearly a currency of photography and all visual storytelling. Though a swaging

298
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:19,130
loneliness is something else, I asked Isadora who needed who the most?

299
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:23,930
Was it her needing her subjects or her subjects needing her and her answer is

300
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:28,700
really striking is when she says that neither need each other but I want them

301
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:33,380
and they want me, which is I believe a normal response in a long-term

302
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:37,790
relationship. There's a great deal more to pick up on and once again you've just

303
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:41,270
heard one short edit of a series of interviews, the rest of which you can now

304
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:45,800
access via the extended playlist. There's also an additional deep dive interview

305
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:50,720
with Everyday Africa photographer Nana Kofi Acquah. In that, he addresses the

306
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,950
courses key questions and thinks about notions of interpretation. You'll hear

307
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:58,850
him describe why he believes the messenger must tune themselves to become

308
00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:03,020
a reflection of the message. Nana also brings a particularly valuable

309
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:06,740
perspective coming as it does from his professional backgrounds in both radio

310
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:11,600
journalism and advertising. Hopefully, we'll see you next week in the webinar

311
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,660
and be sure to submit your four corners image in time for it to be included in

312
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:18,830
the review, don't forget to dig around in the class notes, investigate the hotspots

313
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:22,610
and see why particular parts of the conversations are being responded to and

314
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:26,570
by whom. Reach out and connect with people and where you can support those

315
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:28,790
who can't get into a roomful of fellow students.

316
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:33,080
I'm Jonathan Wirth and you can connect with me via twitter at Jonathan
