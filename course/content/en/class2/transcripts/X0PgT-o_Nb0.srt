00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,629
Hello I'm Jonathan Worth from the Connected Academy, today's conversation is between

2
00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:07,020
the photographer Isadora Kosofsky
and subjects from her long-term

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:11,010
documentary project Vinny and David.
Five years in the making, Vinnie and

4
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:14,309
David takes a humanizing look at
juvenile incarceration through the

5
00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:17,640
dysfunctional lives of two young
brothers and their extended family.

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,960
The audience perspective is provided by Peter DiCampo, now Peter isn't someone we'd

7
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:27,300
readily associate with issues of mass
incarceration or juvenile detention,

8
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,179
but the reason we've asked him to be a part of this conversation, is because of his

9
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:34,290
role as Everyday Africa co-founder. Now
if you're not familiar with Everyday

10
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:37,320
Africa it's a collective of
photographers whose mission it is to

11
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,100
provide a fresh perspective of the
continent beyond the usual stereotypes

12
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,879
of war poverty and famine, so when we're
thinking about how images are

13
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:49,680
interpreted then for me and many like me
that project is stand-out. Make sure you

14
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,180
visit their Instagram page. Pete Brooke
is our subject-specialist and he gives a

15
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:58,920
contextual overview. Many of us know Pete
from his days writing for Wired, others

16
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,190
know him for his prison photography
project through which he pretty much

17
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:07,740
defined the genre and word of warning, if
you're new to that blog, it's a

18
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,680
proverbial rabbit hole of the many
different forms of image making that

19
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,280
relate to mass incarceration. The
conversation you're going to listen to

20
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,600
is particularly rich and like all the
talking pictures sessions there are a

21
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,409
bunch of different ways that you can
unpick it. Our primary question for this

22
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:26,430
week is, who are you talking to? And
thinking in particular about how the

23
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:30,689
audience will interpret the material we
present them with. You're going to hear

24
00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:33,509
about Isadora's approach to
storytelling, how she searches out her

25
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:37,140
subjects and when she finds them, how she builds, and commits to long-term

26
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:41,189
relationships. You're also going to hear
about how the process of doing the

27
00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:44,820
interviews for this course have affected
Isadora, how they've made her reflect on

28
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:48,840
the impact she's had on her subjects and
as you listen to it, it's worth

29
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,490
considering how our approaches to
storytelling affect the story itself.

30
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:56,369
You're going to find that context is a
recurring theme in this talk in many

31
00:01:56,369 --> 00:02:00,540
different guises. As you listen to
Felicia describe her incomprehension at

32
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:05,070
why anyone would want to see photographs
of their lowest moments, we might also

33
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:09,060
ask ourselves what are the moments we've
considered photographs to be unnecessary

34
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,860
or inappropriate?
Are there moments in life where

35
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:18,500
photography is entirely obsolete and how
might that change with context? What are

36
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:23,870
the contextual ingredients required for
the mundane to become interesting? Or,

37
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:29,959
of consequence? As in the case here where, as Isadora says, they may have a deeper social

38
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:35,269
resonance and as always don't forget to use the platform to share your notes and

39
00:02:35,269 --> 00:02:40,040
to comment on other people's. Listen to
the audio in your own time. Take time to

40
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:45,080
pause, reflect, revisit sections you're
not sure about, and take time to dig

41
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:49,160
around in the networked class as well.
Investigate other people's notes see

42
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:52,941
who's making them where and why.

43
00:02:52,941 --> 00:02:56,840
[Isadora] I met Vinny when he was 13 at the

44
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:04,040
juvenile detention center in Albuquerque
New Mexico and I was intrigued. There was

45
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:10,040
something striking about how small he
was in stature he was also striking that

46
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:19,070
he was so,  confident. I followed him into
the unit and he sat by himself in an

47
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:26,959
empty row of chairs. I sat down next to
him and I asked him what are you doing

48
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:29,480
here?

49
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:29,980
[Vinny] I got in trouble for defending my
mom.
[Isadora] He had been arrested for stabbing

50
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,186
 

51
00:03:31,186 --> 00:03:32,420
 

52
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:37,730
the man who was assaulting his mother,
who we had already witnessed for many

53
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:44,720
year,s being abused by men, and he began
crying.
[Vinny] I defended my mother and the

54
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:49,269
right way I was taught, in the right way
I knew. Wasn't trying to hurt nobody but

55
00:03:49,269 --> 00:03:56,269
unfortunately, I had no choice 
[Isadora] It was an act of heroism, unfortunately the

56
00:03:56,269 --> 00:04:02,030
Police could not prove it to be that and
they arrested Vinny and brought him to

57
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:08,860
the youth jail. Vinny began telling me
about his relationship with his brother..

58
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:14,930
[Vinny] Not that  he's not a man I know he is, he's just now, less of a man.
[Isadora]  he told me his

59
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:20,479
brother wasn't good but he wasn't bad, he
was somebody that he loved and admired,

60
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:27,950
kind of father figure, and I was
intrigued. 
[Vinny] I see two brothers that love each

61
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:32,930
other unconditionally, but one brother
wasn't there when the brother needed him

62
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:38,530
to be there, and at that specific moment
the younger brother had to become the

63
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:41,599
much more mature and older brother.

64
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:46,510
[Isadora] I had been looking for a family that bared the

65
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:52,789
dynamics that I was trying to tell in
the juvenile detention facility. I saw

66
00:04:52,789 --> 00:04:58,580
Vinny and I knew that he was going to be
the subject of a long term project and

67
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:06,430
that is an internal, visceral reaction
similar to

68
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:15,130
falling in love (?). I knew that he was
somebody that I wanted to know. I wanted

69
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:20,560
to know about him. I wanted to know about
his mother. I wanted to know about his

70
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:26,770
brother. It was a curiosity. It was a
connection that I felt burning inside of

71
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:32,370
me that I had to pursue. 
[Jonathan] Prison Photography blog founder Pete Brooke.

72
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:38,350
[Pete] Every year two million youth are
arrested in the United States. On any

73
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:43,750
given night there are at least 60,000
children behind bars, some estimates have

74
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:49,449
as high as 65 thousand. With an average
cost of 80 thousand dollars per year to

75
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:53,889
lock up a child, the U.S. spends more
than five billion annually on youth

76
00:05:53,889 --> 00:05:59,169
detention. In the more wealthy states
such as California it can cost up to two

77
00:05:59,169 --> 00:06:02,669
hundred thousand per year to incarcerate
a single child.

78
00:06:02,669 --> 00:06:07,930
By contrast spending in the California
public school system ranges from seven

79
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:13,000
thousand to eighteen thousand per
student, per year. Throughout the 80s and

80
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,310
90s juvenile detention began to mimic
the adult systems.

81
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:21,460
Lawmakers failed to adequately
distinguish between the transgressions

82
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:26,229
of adults and the waywardness of youth.
Juvenile systems built facilities that

83
00:06:26,229 --> 00:06:31,389
functioned like adult prisons.
Incapacitation became the mantra and in

84
00:06:31,389 --> 00:06:36,039
such a political climate, rehabilitation
for youth was sidelined or suspended

85
00:06:36,039 --> 00:06:42,010
altogether. During an uptick in violent
crime in the eighties and nineties there emerge a

86
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:47,409
hysteria about young criminals. They were
brandished super-predators. Feral

87
00:06:47,409 --> 00:06:52,840
teenagers that terrorized society. Of
course this wasn't the case but several

88
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:57,520
high-profile crimes in the new stoked
public fear and the stage was set for

89
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:02,590
harsher punishments of youth. In the
United States where race and class are

90
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:06,430
so tightly intertwined, a
disproportionate number of economically

91
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:11,680
disadvantaged people are of minority groups.
Poorer people suffer to a greater extent

92
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:17,620
at the hands of inflexible casual
systems. Minority youth bare the brunt of

93
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:23,159
youth imprisonment.
Poor white children also have a rough

94
00:07:23,159 --> 00:07:27,599
ride it should be noted,  but if we're to
understand crime and punishment in the

95
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:32,090
US we must acknowledge its racial bias.

96
00:07:32,599 --> 00:07:38,490
Children from poorer backgrounds are in
some ways set up to fail. For its within

97
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:43,409
disadvantaged communities that truancy,
acting out, unstable home conditions,

98
00:07:43,409 --> 00:07:49,139
fractured families, sexual and physical
abuse, crimes of need and a host of other

99
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:54,779
social problems, exist at higher
frequencies. Children from poorer

100
00:07:54,779 --> 00:07:59,669
backgrounds are in some ways set up to
fail. For its within disadvantaged

101
00:07:59,669 --> 00:08:04,800
communities that truancy,
acting out, unstable home conditions,

102
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,960
fractured families, sexual and physical assaults, crimes of need and a host of other

103
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:15,270
social problems exist in higher
concentration. It is in disadvantaged

104
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:20,250
communities that many delinquent youth
grow up. Now some children locked away in

105
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:25,610
the US prison system have caused harm,
but they themselves have been harmed.

106
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:30,589
They may have victimised people but it
is safe to assume that in most cases,

107
00:08:30,589 --> 00:08:32,460
they are victims themselves.

108
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:36,930
One does not need to look far to find children in

109
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:41,810
prison who have been coerced, bullied,
assaulted, pimped or abandoned.

110
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:48,510
For youth in such dire struggles we need to ask ourselves if prison cells are an

111
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:53,260
adequate solution to the many many
underlying social problems.

112
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:59,060
Intervention may be necessary, but all research has shown alternatives to incarceration and

113
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:03,899
supervision within the community, results
in lower recidivism better treatments,

114
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:09,649
better education, and more cohesive
relationships, and better Public Safety.

115
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:14,870
Prisons, especially youth prisons, do not
make us safer.

116
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:20,740
Do children need punishment or guidance?
Do we want revenge or healing?

117
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:28,000
And as a society do we want to be retributive or restorative?

118
00:09:28,016 --> 00:09:30,149
[Isadora] When I began photographing

119
00:09:30,149 --> 00:09:35,410
Vinny I knew that I had to photograph David his

120
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:39,449
older brother as well,
I needed to photograph their mother, I

121
00:09:39,449 --> 00:09:45,920
needed to photograph the entire family
in order to understand Vinny.

122
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:52,300
I particularly wanted to tell this
intersecting story of the love between

123
00:09:52,319 --> 00:09:59,680
two brothers, because I felt that most
people would not be able to relate to

124
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:06,220
these stories of incarceration, but I
needed to find a thread that would allow

125
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:11,800
people to empathize with this family.
It's actually not about telling the

126
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:17,310
stories of incarceration, it's telling
the stories of what I consider to be

127
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:26,620
trans-carceral, meaning the walls
extend outside the facility into all

128
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:32,980
areas of social life. Had I just
photographed Vinny I would have

129
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:36,360
simplified the story.

130
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,380
[Jonathan] Everyday Africa co-founder; Peter DiCampo

131
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:43,380
[Peter] To me her work is so much about
what it can teach to an audience, what we

132
00:10:43,389 --> 00:10:48,519
can learn from it and the degree to which
humanising these characters, helps us

133
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:55,990
understand more about the system of
incarceration as a broader issue. So much

134
00:10:55,990 --> 00:11:00,880
of what she's trying to accomplish here
is a degree of the why basically, you

135
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:06,339
know, why do these things happen? Why this particular boy? The social factors that

136
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:09,160
lead up to this, the family factors that
lead up to this.

137
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:14,700
Issues of incarceration  have been painted a certain way especially in the States and the, the sort of

138
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:18,490
war on drugs mentality that I grew up
with -  you know criminals and

139
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:22,360
quote/unquote bad guys are basically
synonymous, in the same way that I feel

140
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:27,810
the coverage of the African continent
that I grew up with made Africa and

141
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:34,180
famine and war kind of synonymous. If you
showed incarceration purely as people in

142
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:37,329
prison, it shows what life in prison is
like, or in this case life in a youth

143
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:41,230
facility but, it doesn't answer any of our
questions of how did we get to this

144
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:45,490
point. Of course she moved out of what
she calls the carceral setting because

145
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:50,470
you have to get into the family life, and
of course,  once you get into their family

146
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:54,820
life through following her photo essay, 
it just teaches you that there's so much

147
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,540
more to the situation.

148
00:11:56,540 --> 00:12:00,459
[Isadora] The biggest hurdle was gaining David, the

149
00:12:00,459 --> 00:12:07,740
older brother's trust, David said to me 
"I've never really liked pictures,

150
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:16,329
pictures don't lie ,a photo is evidence"
that's something that has stuck with me

151
00:12:16,329 --> 00:12:24,069
as I've worked with that family,  that I
needed to make photos into catalysts for

152
00:12:24,069 --> 00:12:30,550
compassion because photography is used as a weapon against families like Vinny and

153
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:37,449
David's family. I had to show them that
that could be a portal into hope rather

154
00:12:37,449 --> 00:12:42,320
than something that could further
destroy their family dynamic.

155
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:46,660
[Jonathan] One of the extended family members that became a part of the project was Felicia -

156
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:47,840
David's girlfriend.

157
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:53,620
[Felicia] First time you met DJ (David)? Was after you had already met Vinny,

158
00:12:53,620 --> 00:13:01,360
so to meet his older brother, was like,
really intriguing to you. You had a big

159
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:07,600
smile on your face and you were just so excited and  were like just amazed by it

160
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:08,900
to meet Vinny's older brother

161
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:15,040
he always talks so much about. He thought you were CYFD (Child Youth and Family Dept.)

162
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,420
and he closed the door in your face!

163
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,500
[Isadora] He originally didn't want me in his life,

164
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:25,920
not only because he feared that I
was someone in a position of legal

165
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:31,240
authority like a social worker for this
state or even a police officer at one

166
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:38,710
point. He also at one point, feared that I
was going to take his photo and then

167
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:46,300
vanish with it. And I had to over time
show him that first of all I wasn't just

168
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:52,270
going to vanish because that's not
within my practice, but also that the

169
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:59,680
photos in and of themselves negate
abandonment because being able to

170
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,360
document someone's life is seeing them.

171
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:06,060
[Felicia] I always thought you know this is just  another

172
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,400
person that's going to be in and out of
my life and I'll forget 'n you know a

173
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:13,600
couple years not even never think of
them again or something and totally did

174
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:18,370
nothing like that and then glad it
didn't.You became so close with me and

175
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:22,810
everybody in the family it was like, just
meant so much more.

176
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:23,920
[Isadora] They, like Vinny,

177
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:30,339
don't have an understanding that their
story is of value and seeing somebody

178
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:36,700
return, and show them that they matter, by
returning to take more photos, by

179
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:41,420
returning to interview more, by returning
to just be in the space with them.

180
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:45,780
[Felicia] At first honestly I was a little nervous about being photographed by somebody I

181
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:49,780
didn't know and what my pictures were
going to be used for, who was gonna

182
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:57,040
see 'em and stuff like that but then,
just became kind of natural have you

183
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:02,530
take pictures of us. I mean, even at some
of the worst of the worst, baddest times

184
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:06,290
like it was
natural that we'd let you take pictures

185
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:14,480
of us and be there and be a part of the family, kinda.
[Isadora] Like Felicia says in her interview I

186
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:22,399
became a part of that family in a sense
and that they grew to anticipate my

187
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:29,750
arrival and accepted that I was there
maybe not enjoyed at certain times but

188
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:34,700
they accepted that I was there. 
[Felicia] Sometimes when we were really low or down or

189
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,490
y'know going through rough times and you
would be taking pictures y'know, we're

190
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:41,930
outside crying or whatever, having drama
and you'd be taking pictures and I would

191
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:46,279
just be like man! This is really
uncomfortable, like, who wants pictures of

192
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:53,330
this crazy "drama-ness"? But then after
a while it just was like, very more

193
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:57,260
meaningful that you were there in those
hard times and took pictures of us then

194
00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:01,910
because looking back at those photos, it
really makes you think, it makes you feel

195
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:08,209
that again, like and to know that 
somebody caught all that emotion in one

196
00:16:08,209 --> 00:16:14,480
picture is crazy. 
[Isadora] When she mentioned the
first time that I photographed an

197
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:22,760
intense sequence of events in a parking
lot it was enlightening and moving to

198
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:29,959
hear her say that she now realises the
value in the meaning of those types of

199
00:16:29,959 --> 00:16:35,510
photos and how it's in those moments
that people are able to be brought into

200
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:40,370
this family and able to identify and
empathise with them. Documentary

201
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:46,730
photography lessens loneliness for its
audience members because it creates

202
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:53,600
these relatable ties between subjects
and audience. But it also lessens loneliness

203
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:59,390
for the subject and it is definitely
lessened my loneliness to work on these

204
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:05,000
stories.
[Vinny]  At that time I had been to my
aunt Becky's and you called and talked

205
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,780
to me and Vicky and asked if you could
come up to take some photographs for us

206
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:15,350
on our project and she said yeah and you
did show up. That was around the time I

207
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:19,160
had started being
trustworthy with you like, I knew that

208
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:24,910
you were trustworthy I should say.
[Isadora] I'm not cognisant of an audience when I'm

209
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:30,080
starting a project on someone.
Particularly when working on a long term

210
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:36,320
series you have to shoot for the subject
and you have to shoot in relation to the

211
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:41,390
curiosity that you have about that
subject. Because at the end of the day

212
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:45,170
the person most impacted is going to be
the subject.

213
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:47,060
[Peter] I think the responsibility

214
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:52,610
that she feels to the subjects in this
case is directly tied in to the idea of

215
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:57,890
long form journalism of respecting their
vulnerability respecting the power that

216
00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:06,020
she has in this situation.
[Isadora] when I showed the photos to Vinnie in 2014 before

217
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:14,720
it went live on time.com. I asked him if the
photo essay, the edit, not the photos in

218
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:20,210
general, the edit that was going to be
published was true to his experience

219
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:25,380
and he said "Yes", and that's when I knew it
was ready to be shown.

220
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:34,120
[Vinny] The first time I had actually seen a photograph of me it was in the visitation room with my mother.

221
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:40,490
We were both crying. The picture
reminds me that that at that moment I

222
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:48,470
felt down, just downgraded and I couldn't
do nothing. I felt what I said less of a

223
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:56,330
human, when I see that photo. 
[Felicia] their mom cried for weeks and weeks when she saw

224
00:18:56,330 --> 00:19:02,150
that I mean still to this day I bet you
if you brought that, that, your story up

225
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:06,950
in the project and read it out loud or
were just showing pictures anything, any

226
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:15,020
part of that project, like his mom would
still cry to this day like and it same

227
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:21,500
for me like, it's just so meaningful and
sad but yet brings so much joy at the

228
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:26,810
same time to know that somebody put so
much effort in to tell their story when

229
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:32,790
it was like, we were the lowest below like who wants

230
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:37,340
even be around us, see us, let alone care
about what we're going to are

231
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:43,680
photographing us at the lowest of the
low like, and that that's, that's deep right there

232
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:48,870
[Isadora] I didn't know that they cried when
they saw the first article through Time.

233
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:57,200
I didn't know that they cried when they
would look at the photos that I sent and

234
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:08,100
that has changed the way that I look at
my subjects, because I feel seen. Not only

235
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:14,040
do they see themselves in my photos, they
also see me.
[Felicia]  I look at things a lot

236
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:20,970
different now towards journalism and you
know photography than I did when I met

237
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:28,470
you, but in another sense when I do think
about journalism now or photography I

238
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:35,490
only think of you.
[Isadora] her love for me was something that was only revealed in the

239
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:42,840
interview. When I photograph her when I'm
around her there's a level of restraint

240
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:50,210
that I experience from her. It is a
complex dynamic between that family and

241
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:56,010
my identity as a photographer. I don't need them and

242
00:20:56,010 --> 00:21:04,080
they don't need me, but I want them, and
they want me, which is I believe a normal

243
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:10,140
response to a long-term relationship.
[Vinny]  I'm glad that the project happened.

244
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:16,520
That's what has kept me kept me going this
straight path that I have. Just hearing

245
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:21,690
everything and seeing everything the way
it was explained it would be. I don't see

246
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:26,940
an end I do not. Only see the project
getting better therefore I can only do

247
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:32,580
better. I can only get a job, or a house,
or show you, not you, not the project, not

248
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:37,680
society, not nobody except my family, that
it won't get better so that we want to

249
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:41,790
make the project better.
[Isadora] I know that Vinnie mentioned that he

250
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:47,250
feels that I've, somewhat inspired him to have

251
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:53,160
a healthy life. I don't know if that's
entirely true), but I am happy to have

252
00:21:53,160 --> 00:22:00,060
been one of the first people to listen
to him and it appears from his interview

253
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:06,330
that that has greatly affected him that
somebody has shown interest in him.

254
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:14,200
Someone has committed to his story and
someone has seen his story as a valuable artifact.

255
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:18,540
[Vinny] I kind of almost questioned why
did it happen? Like, that's the only thing

256
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:23,550
to say to that. Like why did it happen? I
always had thought you were a beautiful

257
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:28,640
woman and that was that was the main
thing. You were a beautiful woman and you

258
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:35,880
were in such a disgusting place and I
did ask questions like, what the heck?

259
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:40,800
[Isadora] My life has changed since I did that interview with him I have never asked them those

260
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:46,320
questions and I've worked with them
almost six years. So it has really, really

261
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:51,240
shaped, not only the way I work, but even
the way that I see myself.

262
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:57,880
To people listening this may seem odd but in the process that I go through as a

263
00:22:57,890 --> 00:23:04,640
photojournalist I try and overlook that
I feel that I am invisible. I very much

264
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:09,810
overlook the fact that I am even a
person sometimes when I'm shooting

265
00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:17,100
because I have to be a kind of welcoming
wall. Because I'm in a capacity of using

266
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:23,340
the photographs to create larger change
than I would be able to in a moment of

267
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:29,040
reaction in that space, with that family.
[Felicia] I have to say I was a little nervous a

268
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:33,330
little scared. Like you know, a little
worried about who was going to see the

269
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:38,700
pictures or what we said about me or, y'know I didn't really understand fully

270
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:46,260
the whole meaning or process of the
project or whatnot but when it came out

271
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:53,790
it was it was crazy it was so amazing
and the way the story was told through

272
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:57,940
pictures like I think touched everybody.

273
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:05,940
[Vinny] I got pulled over, and I cop had ran my name, and he had came back to my vehicle and he asked me:  "You're Vincent aren't you?"

274
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,580
I said yes sir I am. He goes "you're on the internet for er..

275
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:12,760
defending your mom and I didn't know
that that was what that was for"

276
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:18,820
and I said yeah and he goes: "Well good job!" And that brought me confidence.

277
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:24,820
I think that the photos are trying to show society that,  I am human.

278
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:30,380
[Jonathan]  I've listened to this now they must be a hundred times and I never cease to be moved by it.

279
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:34,320
Benjamin Chesterton rounds off the
discussion of Dalia he sees work on "The

280
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:38,429
Missing" by saying that these
conversations between the subject and

281
00:24:38,429 --> 00:24:43,440
the photographer may be more humanising
than the photographs alone.

282
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:47,460
I wonder how listening to Vincent and
Felicia has affected your reading of the

283
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:52,080
work? Do you think the images are an
accurate reflection of the relationship

284
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:56,460
you've just heard about? There's so much
in that talk and there's a whole lot

285
00:24:56,460 --> 00:25:01,500
more in the extended versions in fact I
think this talk is probably most notable

286
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,769
for how much has been edited out, how
much we've had to edit out because

287
00:25:04,769 --> 00:25:08,669
there's so much great stuff. But I'm just
going to pick up on a few things that

288
00:25:08,669 --> 00:25:12,210
blew me away and we can pick up that
conversation in Twitter, I'm sure there's

289
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:15,870
lots that you've got to talk about.
There's a moment in there where Isadora

290
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:20,789
talks about "overlooking her own impact".
In the full interview she talks about

291
00:25:20,789 --> 00:25:24,779
being part of the fabric of the moment
and that's probably a convenient

292
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:29,600
oversight that most, perhaps all
photographers make it to some degree.

293
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,780
It makes me wonder should we, as
photographers, appear in the frame more

294
00:25:32,789 --> 00:25:36,899
often? I mean, I don't recall an occasion
where a photojournalist appears in their

295
00:25:36,899 --> 00:25:40,620
own image. I mean they're probably some
out there, there's plenty where they

296
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:44,129
include other photographers perhaps our
nod to the presence of the storyteller.

297
00:25:44,129 --> 00:25:49,169
But none where they themselves
acknowledge their impact. To be clear I'm

298
00:25:49,169 --> 00:25:52,769
not talking about new journalism where
the journalist is at the center of the

299
00:25:52,769 --> 00:25:55,559
story.
I think I'm responding to Isadora

300
00:25:55,559 --> 00:26:00,330
saying that she shoots for her subjects
and her subjects become her friends or

301
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:05,610
by her commitment to their relationship
her friends become her subjects. She says

302
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:09,570
she doesn't shoot for an audience, or
that she isn't cognisant of an audience,

303
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:14,460
more accurately, but we shouldn't take
away from that she isn't mindful of them

304
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:18,860
I don't think. I mean she's not
photographing in a creative vacuum.

305
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:22,769
If anything she's hyper-aware of the
audience, I mean she talks about

306
00:26:22,769 --> 00:26:26,549
photography being weaponised. She
might not be shooting for an audience

307
00:26:26,549 --> 00:26:30,100
but I would argue that she's definitely
editing a version of the world for one.

308
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:34,060
She says, she couldn't limit herself to
images of Vinny in a carceral setting.

309
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:38,220
That the setting would define the
subject. She introduces us to the notion

310
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:42,260
of "trans-carceral" and says that she needed to photograph the mother, the brother,

311
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:46,620
in order to make photographs that act as
"catalysts for empathy" (I love that phrase)

312
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:51,570
she's looking to make sort of, bridges,
between the subject and the audience.

313
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:55,619
I'm put in mind of the advice that the
photographer Lisette Modell purportedly

314
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:57,460
gave to a young Diane Arbus:

315
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:01,880
"The more specific you are the more general you'll be"

316
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:05,340
In other words, if you want to talk
about ageing, then photograph your

317
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:10,080
grandparents, because everyone can relate
personally to the notion of a

318
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:14,230
grandparent figure and each of us will have "relateable ties",

319
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:19,390
as Isadora calls them, with the idea of
a mother, a brother, a girlfriend, a

320
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:24,930
boyfriend, just as we will a warm embrace
or a tearful hug and the catastrophic

321
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:31,430
loneliness that must come to an isolated,
incarcerated, 13-year old child

322
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:36,180
I also found a wake up call for me as
the audience I didn't expect that.

323
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,740
My impact.

324
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:41,780
She says: she didn't know the family cried when they saw the pictures

325
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,640
that's the moment we, as audience, and the subject shared,

326
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:50,400
they saw their lives re-contextualised. The photographic

327
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,280
equivalent of an out-of-body experience.

328
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:56,700
They were looking on the story of that time in their lives

329
00:27:56,700 --> 00:28:00,080
but through a third set of eyes

330
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:04,260
and also for the first time experiencing
those moments without Isadora in them

331
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:08,010
without the photographer present, think
about that, your subject with whom you've

332
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:11,550
built a trust relationship and who's
allowed you to make their picture

333
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:18,150
will be alone in front of an audience
come publication and on one level, your

334
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:21,150
picture will be a portrait of your relationship with them.

335
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:25,050
Isadora says, again in the extended
interview, that she feels the social

336
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:28,860
resonance of the work comes with the
personal connections she forms with

337
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:35,580
those subjects, and as photographers
ourselves of widely differing ages and

338
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:40,410
backgrounds I wonder, how do you think Isadora's age (relative to her subjects)

339
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:47,250
her gender and her race, affect the story?
How important is she? Isadora talks about

340
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:51,210
her approach to photography "negating
abandonment" which was something of a

341
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:55,020
revelation to me and both Vinnie and
Felicia refer to the fact that she

342
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:59,370
returned, that she did what she said
she'd do, and how important that was for

343
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:02,580
them and then Isadora builds on that by
reflecting on how documentary

344
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:07,200
photography's "relatable ties" lessen
loneliness for her personally. And the

345
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:12,139
subject and the audience too.
Perhaps that's a part of the currency of

346
00:29:12,139 --> 00:29:15,379
this work and this way of working, the
photographer

347
00:29:15,379 --> 00:29:21,409
leverages a loneliness that's inherent
in us all. Simon Norfolk says that for

348
00:29:21,409 --> 00:29:26,119
his work, beauty is a seductive tool.
He'll draw the audience in with a

349
00:29:26,119 --> 00:29:30,919
beautiful image so that he can incite
their curiosity about the subject. That's

350
00:29:30,919 --> 00:29:34,100
clearly a currency of photography and a
visual storytelling in general but I've

351
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:38,210
never really thought of loneliness as
being similar before.

352
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:44,330
I asked Isadora who needed who the most?
Was it her needing her subjects? Or her

353
00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:49,040
subjects needing her? And I think her
answer is really striking, its where she

354
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:53,750
says that neither of us need each other,
but I want them and they want me which is,

355
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:58,140
I believe a normal response to a
long-term relationship.

356
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:04,760
I mean that makes me wonder again how important Isadora is to this piece of work? I wonder if,

357
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:11,460
if I could have done it? As a 44 year old white male. I wonder if each of us

358
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:16,560
different ages, gender, cultural
backgrounds, could have made the same piece of work?

359
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,620
So now is the time to revisit your four corners image prior to submitting it,

360
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:23,720
but before you do that you
can now access the deep-dive materials

361
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:27,980
for this session and the full-length
interviews. You'll be able to access the

362
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:31,460
interview with everyday Africa
photographer Nana Kofi Acqua and hear

363
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:34,909
him address the courses key questions, all
of them.

364
00:30:34,909 --> 00:30:40,860
And think about, think again about this notion of interpretation. You'll hear him describe why he believes

365
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:44,700
"the messenger must tune himself to become a reflection of the message".

366
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,120
It's a particularly valuable perspective

367
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:52,120
coming as he does from backgrounds in
both radio journalism and advertising.

368
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:57,140
Hopefully we'll see you next week in the
webinar, but be sure to submit your four corners image

369
00:30:57,140 --> 00:31:00,420
in time for it to be
included in the review.

370
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,580
In the next session we're thinking about Fiction, and we'll be talking about the amazing Tim Hetherington

371
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:07,300
with his Trust's director Steven Mayes.

372
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:13,320
The Mexico City based photographer Dominic Bracco joins us , and so does Professor of Criticism,  
Susie Linfield

373
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,680
I'm Jonathan Worth, and you can connect with me via twitter:
