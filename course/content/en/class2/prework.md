## This week's task

Constructing complex and nuanced narratives that follow the connected lives of multiple subjects over an extended period is ambitious for a week’s activity. However Isadora’s deep concerns about how images of her subjects will be interpreted and her trans-carceral storytelling solution, share a great deal with the concept of context-rich Four Corners images.

For this activity you should work collaboratively with a subject to create a context-rich portrait. The rich metadata should inform a much deeper understanding and, having thought  very carefully about how the images will be interpreted, you should include the subject’s reflections and responses to the process in the backstory (BL). 

Use each of the corners creatively and do not feel restricted by our examples. Adapt the format to suit your passion for image making and storytelling. Your 4C image should be a story in itself, more akin to a moment from a movie than a traditional photograph. If you choose to make an artistic or fictional portrait be sure to reflect that choice in your Code of Ethics (BR).
