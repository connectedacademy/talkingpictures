  “I didn’t know they cried when they saw the photographs” Photographer Isadora
  Kosofsky for this project. Welcome to The World Press Photo Foundation's
  Talking Pictures, a new kind of photography course where photographers, their
  subjects and audiences come together. This week sees US based Photographer
  Isadora Kosofsky in conversation with subjects from her long term project
  Vinny and David: Life and Incarceration of a Family
---
## Interpretation: Introduction

As photographers it is sometimes convenient, and sometimes critical, to imagine ourselves as being detached from the things we witness. However the further we move from spot-news to longer form storytelling, the greater the impact our presence will have on the lives of our subjects, and so, the stories of those lives that we tell. For the subjects, the moment of publication can be transformative. A moment where, for the first time, they become a member of the audience looking in on themselves. Where they’re forced to interpret and reinterpret their story in new contexts, be them a glossy magazine, a newspaper, a gallery or a website.

In these interviews we began by considering how our images might be interpreted and in addressing that, Isadora describes how her long form way of working, is critical for her to enable a rich and complex understanding of her subjects. We hear how she builds layers of narrative, which spread out from her primary and central character, in order to tell the “trans-carceral” story of an extended family. We hear from those subjects and, for the first time, Isadora hears them describe her, her impact and the impact of this work.

The writer and Prison Photography blog founder Pete Brook, provides social and historical background to the project and Every Day Africa co-founder Peter DiCampo, draws parallels with how audience interpretation was so critical to the success of his work. 

Together they invite us to ask questions of the work on different levels: what do the differences in money spent incarcerating youth versus money spent educating them, tell us about political attitudes in the USA? What was the media’s impact in depicting “feral teenagers” and “super-predators”? And what of our 13 year old subject? What of the language used by Isadora, by Vincent and by Felicia to describe their experiences? Isadora talks about long term relationships, about commitment and abandonment. Vincent describes feeling less of a human at one point and Felicia falls in love. 

These are starting points, other questions will appear in the transcript but please add your own and be sure to share your thoughts, comments and notes as you listen.

Peter DiCampo is a documentary photographer whose goal is to contribute his work to a dialogue on international development and perceptions of Africa. He began his career as a Peace Corps Volunteer and a traditional photojournalist—now, his work seeks to deconstruct that experience. He is a co-founder of Everyday Africa, the Instagram-based project that has blossomed into a global phenomenon, and he is a regular speaker in classrooms and workshops on media stereotypes and the promotion of localized storytelling. He was among the first recipients of the Impact AFRICA grant in 2017 and was on the jury of the first Addis FotoFest Awards in 2016.
