Laurel had been diagnosed with breast cancer some 17 years earlier, Howie was told he had terminal pancreatic cancer in December 2012. They chose to spend their last months creating new memories, rather than becoming preoccupied with their troubles. Their family used the time they all had left together to the fullest. Howie died on 7 December 2013, a year and a day after his cancer was discovered. After that, Laurel’s cancer worsened and she passed away on 6 December 2014.\n\nThe photographer is Laurel and Howie’s daughter. She chose to document her parents’ final chapters in order to hold on to their memory, and to capture their essence and strength in a trying time. She wanted to focus on their love, both individually and for each other. She says that everyone wants to find purpose in their lives, and that Laurel and Howie’s final purpose was found in this moment, in the gift they gave her of allowing her to tell their story. This is their legacy.","author":"Nancy Borowick","magazine":"New York Times Lens Blog","magazineUrl":"https://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/03/14/cancer-family-nancy-borowick-kickstarter-book/","date":"March 14, 2016"},"creativeCommons":{"copyright":"Nancy Borowick © 2013","codeOfEthics":"World Press Photo Code of Ethics: entrants to the World Press Photo contest must ensure their pictures provide an accurate and fair representation of the scene they witnessed so the audience is not misled.
