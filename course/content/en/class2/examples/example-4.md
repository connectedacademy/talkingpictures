They live in one of the state’s many colonias - unincorporated residential areas without basic infrastructure near the US-Mexico border. The mother, an immigrant from Mexico, makes paper-mâché piñatas to help support herself and her children. Her family numbers among the millions of Americans uncounted by the national census. Officially, they do not exist in the population records that determine not only Texas’ political representation in the United States Congress, but also where new schools, hospitals, firehouses and critical social services are needed.","author":"Lara Jo Regan","magazine":"LIFE","magazineUrl":"https://www.worldpressphoto.org/collection/photo/2001/world-press-photo-year/lara-jo-regan","date":"December 3, 2000"},"creativeCommons":{"copyright":"Lara Jo Regan © 2000","codeOfEthics":"Entrants to the World Press Photo contest must ensure their pictures provide an accurate and fair representation of the scene they witnessed so the audience is not misled.\nThis means that entrants: Should be aware of the influence their presence can exert on a scene they photograph, and should resist being misled by staged photo opportunities.
