It was set up to resist the idea that gay men were not suitable for a heavily masculine sport like rugby, and to counter the stereotypes surrounding gay athletes. Canada is now host to three gay-oriented teams, after the Montreal Armada joined the Ottawa Wolves and Muddy York. A fourth, the Vancouver Rogues, dissolved after players felt they had brought sufficient awareness to issues of inclusion, and now play on mixed teams. Muddy York RFC competes against mainstream teams in the Toronto Rugby Union, and travels to play against other gay teams.","author":"Giovanni Capriotti","publication":"World Press Photo","publicationUrl":"https://www.worldpressphoto.org/collection/photo/2017/sports/giovanni-capriotti","date":"November 5, 2016"},"creativeCommons":{"credit":"Giovanni Capriotti","year":"2016","copyright":"All rights reserved","codeOfEthics":"Photojournalist","description":"Muddy York Rugby Football Club players Michael Smith (left), Devin McCarney (center) and John-Paul Markides rehearse for their performance at the teamâ€™s annual fundraiser drag show."}}
