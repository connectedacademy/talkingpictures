About 150 Lebanese militia fighters killed at least 500 Palestinian civilians, including large numbers of women, children, and the elderly. Estimates of the total death toll range from 500 to 4,000. The armed militia was linked to the Phalange party, allied with the Israeli Defense Force, which at the time occupied Beirut and held the refugee camps under its control.","author":"Robin Moyer","magazine":"Black Star for Time","magazineUrl":"https://www.worldpressphoto.org/collection/photo/1983/world-press-photo-year/robin-moyer","date":"October 18, 1982"},"creativeCommons":{"copyright":"Robin Moyer © 1982","codeOfEthics":"Entrants to the World Press Photo contest must ensure their pictures provide an accurate and fair representation of the scene they witnessed so the audience is not misled","description":"Beirut, Lebanon.

This picture shows a good example of how to creatively communicate something that’s not there; the relatives of refugees on the other side of the ocean, miles away. Like Dalia, the photographer uses personal objects as evidences of the missing social bound: their phones are up in the air, screen lighted, symbolising the hope of connecting with their loved ones. Dalia uses photographs of the missings, old personal items such as cigarettes or bags to bring the viewer into the experience of loss and trauma that her subjects are going through. It is certainly a difficult and sensitive exercise which requires the trust of her subjects. As here, Dalia’s images are intensely quiet, empty and hunting. Although less straight-forward and dramatic than the war photographs showcased here, those images are powerful and moving testimonies of the lasting consequences of war. Dalia Khamissy and John Stanmeyer have both found creative and personal ways to reinforce the feeling of disappearance and therefore, bring to the front light the human consequences of war.
