About 150 Lebanese militia fighters killed at least 500 Palestinian civilians, including large numbers of women, children, and the elderly. Estimates of the total death toll range from 500 to 4,000. The armed militia was linked to the Phalange party, allied with the Israeli Defense Force, which at the time occupied Beirut and held the refugee camps under its control.","author":"Robin Moyer","magazine":"Black Star for Time","magazineUrl":"https://www.worldpressphoto.org/collection/photo/1983/world-press-photo-year/robin-moyer","date":"October 18, 1982"},"creativeCommons":{"copyright":"Robin Moyer © 1982","codeOfEthics":"Entrants to the World Press Photo contest must ensure their pictures provide an accurate and fair representation of the scene they witnessed so the audience is not misled","description":"Beirut, Lebanon.
