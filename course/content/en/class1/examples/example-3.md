Starved and attacked with machetes, he had managed to survive, though he was unable to speak and could barely walk or swallow when this photo was made. The animosity between the Hutu and Tutsi population groups in Rwanda had been simmering for decades. In April 1994, Hutu President Juvénal Habyarimana’s death in a plane crash near the capital of Kigali sparked murderous attacks on the Tutsi minority and Hutu moderates. The situation deteriorated further when the mainly Tutsi rebels of the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) started pushing south from their stronghold in northern Rwanda. A mass exodus of people trying to escape excessive violence was underway by July.","author":"James Natchwey","magazine":"Magnum Photos for Time","magazineUrl":"https://www.worldpressphoto.org/collection/photo/1995/world-press-photo-year/james-nachtwey","date":"June 1, 1994"},"creativeCommons":{"copyright":"James Nachtwey © 1994","codeOfEthics":"Entrants to the World Press Photo contest must ensure their pictures provide an accurate and fair representation of the scene they witnessed so the audience is not misled.","description":"A Hutu man at a Red Cross hospital in Nyanza, Rwanda.
