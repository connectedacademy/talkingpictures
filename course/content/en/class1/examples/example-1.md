This escalated into clashes between rival paramilitary factions. Greece and Turkey became increasingly embroiled in the situation. Greece sent 20,000 troops to the island, while Turkey responded to attacks on Turkish Cypriot areas with air strikes.

This picture from Don McCullin, one of the most renowned war photographers in the world, dates from 1964. This picture could have been taken today, it is timeless and communicate instantly emotions such as grief and suffering. 

While McCullin spent most of his career documenting wars, other photographers, such a Dalia, have been focusing on the aftermath of wars, and on those invisible scars that wars leaves years after the conflict ends.
