Before the war, Lebanon was a multi-sectarian country, where Sunnis, Shias, Maronite Christians, Druze and several other communities lived together in a fragile co-existence. The establishment of the state of Israel, the displacement of hundred thousands of Palestinian refugees to Lebanon, the Cold War with its polarizing influence on Lebanese society, and the arrival in the early 1970s of armed forces of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) all had a disintegrative effect on the country. The civil war started with a series of retaliatory sectarian attacks but would eventually become a long and complicated conflict, which also involved countries from outside Lebanon, including Israel and Syria. When Françoise Demulder came to Amsterdam to receive her World Press Photo of the Year award in 1977, she told the Dutch newspaper Het Vrije Volk that she had gone into the Christian zone on the day the Phalange decided to ‘cleanse’ the neighborhood of Karantina. She explained, “The Christians went from house to house in the Palestinian neighborhood. They shot at everyone there. There were 350 civilians, who ran from their homes crying. Palestinians came out with white flags on their rifles. But the Phalangists kept shooting, not caring who they hit. I had never experienced such a fanatic hatred there before—horrible.” According to Demulder, only the young girl and her child in the background of the image survived the massacre.","author":"Françoise Demulder","magazine":"Commissioned by Gamma","magazineUrl":"https://www.worldpressphoto.org/collection/photo/1977/world-press-photo-year/fran%C3%A7oise-demulder","date":"January 18, 1976"},"creativeCommons":{"copyright":"Françoise Demulder © 1976","codeOfEthics":"Entrants to the World Press Photo contest must ensure their pictures provide an accurate and fair representation of the scene they witnessed so the audience is not misled.","description":"Beirut, Lebanon. A Palestinian woman pleads with a Phalange gunman in the Karantina neighborhood of East Beirut (also known as La Quarantaine). That morning, Phalange militia had attacked and evicted the largely Palestinian refugee population of this district, setting their homes on fire and leaving hundreds dead. The Karantina massacre was one of the many violent incidents marking the first years of the Lebanese civil war"}}
