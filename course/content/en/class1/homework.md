  ‘Tell us the story of something that isn’t there.’ In preparation for the
  class you should use the Four Corners editor to add rich meta-data to an image
  that addresses the theme of absence. Whether the image is new or old, one of
  yours or someone else’s, is up to you but the information within the corners
  should add new layers of meaning for the reader.

# Homework

It is easy as a photographer to respond to the ways things look, and harder to respond to what things mean. For this activity you should tell the story of a subject that is not present within the frame. Your images will have to signify absence or loss, they will have to show traces of a presence. The evidence of something that is missing.
 It might be useful to think of denotation and connotation, the signifier and the signified. We do this all the time when we use emojis, a thumbs-up denotes a severed hand, but means “Okay!“, just as a heart denotes an internal organ, but means “love”. When Dalia chooses to balance a frame with one empty and one occupied chair either side, she prompts us to ask why? What does this empty chair signify? To whom does it belong and why aren’t they there?

Use each of the corners creatively and do not feel restricted by our examples. Adapt the format to suit your passion for image making and storytelling. Your 4C image should be a story in itself, more akin to a moment from a movie than a traditional photograph.

Here are some examples of the kind of thing you might submit:

- dogs
- my wife
- a landscape

When creating your image, thnk carefully about the 4C metadata, and take a look at the [Four Corners Examples](/markdown/class1/extra-pre-reading.md).

Focuse particularly on how evidence...blah blah.
