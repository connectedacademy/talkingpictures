  The World Press Photo Foundation Archive contains over sixty years of iconic
  images. We have selected photographs from each decade that relate to the
  issues being covered in the session, and reimagined them as Four Corners
  Images. It is an example of how 4C can be creatively adapted to add rich
  meta-date to historical images.
