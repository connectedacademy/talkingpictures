  ‘Tell us the story of something that isn’t there.’ In preparation for the
  class you should create a context-rich image. Use the Four Corners Editor to
  add rich meta-data addressing the theme of Absence. Whether the image is new
  or old, one of yours or someone else’s is up to you, but the information
  within the corners should add new layers of meaning for the reader.

## This week's task

It is easy for photographers to respond to the way things look, and harder to respond to what things mean. For this activity you should tell the story of a subject that is not present within the frame. Your images will have to signify absence or loss, they will have to show traces of a presence. The evidence of something that is missing.

It might be useful to think about denotation and connotation, the signifier and the signified. We do this all the time when we use emojis, a thumbs-up denotes a severed hand, but means “Okay!“, just as a heart denotes an internal organ, but means “love” or "affection". 
When Dalia chooses to balance a frame with one empty and one occupied chair either side, she prompts us to ask why? What does this empty chair signify? To whom does it belong and why aren’t they there?

Use each of the corners creatively and do not feel restricted by our examples. Adapt the format to suit your passion for image making and storytelling. Your 4C image should be a story in itself, more akin to a moment from a movie than a traditional photograph.

Thinking of Dalia's _Abandoned Spaces_ and _The Missing_ here are some examples of the kind of things you might submit:

- A Person: the story of a life, or moment within a life. It could be yours or someone else's. Can this story be told through associated objects or other people (TL: Related Images,BL: Backstory)?  
- A Place: a politically or personally significant location. Can historical or geo-located images be used or linked to enrich your metadata (TL: Related Images, TR: Links)?
- An Event: a birthday party, a football match, an election. Tell us this story through the evidence left behind. Can contemporaneous accounts (media/social-media) be used or linked to enrich the metadata (TL: Related Images, TR: Links)?

When creating your image, think carefully about the 4C metadata, and how using it makes you and your story more believable.

## Preparation

In advance of this Class, Using the **Four Corners** Editor, produce an image that tells the story of something that isn’t there. Use the corners to include supporting images, a backstory, any relevant links, your code of ethics and a copyright notice.
