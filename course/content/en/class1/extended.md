# Additional Watching

How do we as photographers tell the story of a subject that is missing? How might one tell the story of loss, of the deceased, the invisible?

How might these images constitute or inform a body of evidence?

How might they and we, be believed?

What role does trust have, and how do we as storytellers gain that trust and imbue our work with it?

## Preparation

Having participated in the live class, produce a **Four Corners** image that tells the story of something that isnâ€™t there. Use the corners to include supporting images, a backstory, any relevant links, your code of ethics and a copyright notice.

Follow [the instructions](/fourcorners.md) to create and upload your submission.
