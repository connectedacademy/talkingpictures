## Re-visit

TODO

Having now had access to all of the learning resources including the audio montage, the connected class-notes, World Press Photo Archive examples, full interviews including deep-dive interview with Rena Effendi, having seen other people's work and had the chance to give and receive feedback on yours, you should either re-visit and re-work your original submission, or create a new one.  

Use the corners to include supporting images, a backstory, any relevant links, your code of ethics and a copyright notice. 

Follow [the instructions](/markdown/fourcorners.md) to create and upload your submission in time for the webinar review.
