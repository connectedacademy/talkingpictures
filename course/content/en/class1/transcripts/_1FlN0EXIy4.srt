00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:02,660
Hello I'm Jonathan from the Connected

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:04,759
Academy. 'Talking Pictures' critical

3
00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:06,529
engagement with visual storytelling is

4
00:00:06,529 --> 00:00:08,180
brought to you in association with the

5
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:12,110
World Press Photo Foundation. This week's

6
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:13,340
conversation is between the Lebanese

7
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:15,170
photographer Dalia Khamissy and

8
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:17,720
subjects for her project 'The Missing'. The

9
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:19,279
audience perspective is provided by a

10
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:22,010
filmmaker Benjamin Chesterton. Additional

11
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:23,990
historical context is provided by Saree

12
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:25,760
Makdisi, professor of English and

13
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,710
Comparative Literature at the University

14
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:30,140
of California, Los Angeles. So on one

15
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:31,550
level we have a photographer and

16
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:33,229
journalist who spent multiple years

17
00:00:33,229 --> 00:00:34,850
making an oral history and visual

18
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:37,010
document of people who've lost family

19
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:38,980
members to a war that started 40 years

20
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:41,300
ago and probably a million miles away

21
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:44,749
from you are now. So I can imagine that

22
00:00:44,749 --> 00:00:46,459
maybe you're thinking what does that got

23
00:00:46,459 --> 00:00:48,319
to do with me? Well, to be honest I don't

24
00:00:48,319 --> 00:00:51,619
I don't really know but maybe if we

25
00:00:51,619 --> 00:00:52,850
think about it slightly differently

26
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:54,799
there are some jumping-off points for

27
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:56,600
you to go and discuss in the connected

28
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,399
notes which is kind of the point the

29
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,529
content we provide today is a starting

30
00:01:00,529 --> 00:01:02,179
point for this conversation it's not the

31
00:01:02,179 --> 00:01:02,829
end.

32
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:05,299
Thinking in particular about themes like

33
00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:10,280
time, evidence, vulnerability, trust and

34
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,189
responsibility there are three areas I

35
00:01:13,189 --> 00:01:14,920
find fascinating about this interview:

36
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:18,820
one, what exactly is it that she's making?

37
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:23,259
two, her approach to making it and three,

38
00:01:23,259 --> 00:01:26,630
what will it eventually come to me? Now, I

39
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:27,530
don't have answers for those questions.

40
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:29,719
I've got a few observations and I've got

41
00:01:29,719 --> 00:01:33,740
a few ideas but I don't have answers. So

42
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:34,939
if I describe it slightly differently

43
00:01:34,939 --> 00:01:37,520
then, you're about to listen to a female

44
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,530
Lebanese photographer who only ever knew

45
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:42,530
war growing up. She became a photo editor

46
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:44,329
but burnt out through the effects of

47
00:01:44,329 --> 00:01:46,399
looking at an unending stream of images

48
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,609
of war and its effects on her own people.

49
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:50,630
You'll hear how she made peace with

50
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:52,340
photography again and then when the war

51
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:54,350
ended and the journalists left, their work

52
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:57,939
done, she began to make her body of work.

53
00:01:57,939 --> 00:02:00,319
It's a series of portraits of people

54
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:02,990
like yourself who are left behind. Each

55
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:04,939
one in a way I'm thinking of as an

56
00:02:04,939 --> 00:02:07,159
archivist, archivists of the scant

57
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:09,049
belongings of the people who didn't come

58
00:02:09,049 --> 00:02:11,569
back. Each one provides another testament

59
00:02:11,569 --> 00:02:13,370
for their loved one and the ages of

60
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:14,190
these people remind us

61
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:16,800
- that well one can imagine a time not

62
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,990
far from now when all that will remain

63
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:21,720
of their stories will be Dalia's project,

64
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,990
'The Missing'. And you have a male English

65
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:26,760
ex-radio producer who doesn't speak

66
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,500
Arabic and who has to produce two

67
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,330
different versions of her project for

68
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:32,520
radio and web audiences over a very

69
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,350
short space of time with all its

70
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:37,020
inherent difficulties. And of course

71
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,160
you're going to hear from the people

72
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,660
whose stories they're both trying to

73
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,610
tell and exactly what that feels like

74
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:46,740
both then and now. Don't forget, make your

75
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,630
notes in the platform, that's where the

76
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:50,790
value is and don't complain if people

77
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:52,200
then comment back on your notes if you

78
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,430
don't comment on theirs. They're like

79
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:55,200
Valentine's cards, if you don't send them

80
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,070
don't expect to get them.

81
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,050
Marhabaan,

82
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:04,150
my name is Dalia Khamissy and I'm a

83
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:07,110
photographer based in Beirut, Lebanon.

84
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:10,330
Since 2010, I have been working on the

85
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:12,970
estimated 17,000 missing and forcibly

86
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:17,380
disappeared from the 1975 to 1990 Lebanese

87
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:24,010
civil war. The victims were from

88
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:25,390
different political and religious

89
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:27,550
backgrounds, they came from all parts of

90
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:30,940
Lebanon and they were of all ages. The

91
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:32,500
kidnappers did not differentiate

92
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:42,550
between men or women at that time. But

93
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:44,140
The Missing was not exactly the first

94
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,270
project I did on the aftermath of wars

95
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:51,730
that I lived. In the summer of 2006, I

96
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:53,440
witnessed the terrible Israeli

97
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,630
aggression on Lebanon as I was working

98
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:59,110
for The Associated Press in its office

99
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:02,820
in Beirut as a photo editor.

100
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:25,750
A year later, I went to the South of

101
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,700
Lebanon, the area that suffered the most

102
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:31,390
during the 2006 war and it was heavily

103
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:36,220
bombarded. I had seen those images during

104
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:39,910
the 2006 war but I had not seen them

105
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:44,200
through my eyes since then. That day I

106
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,690
had my camera with me and I entered

107
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:49,260
homes that were destroyed and abandoned.

108
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:52,720
What really shocked me was how much the

109
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,540
private homes of people had become

110
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:58,690
public. Anyone could enter them because

111
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:01,140
there were no more doors anymore and

112
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:04,780
obviously no more inhabitants. On the

113
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:07,630
floors lay clothes of those who lived

114
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:08,230
there

115
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:11,430
sometimes photographs, belongings, keys.

116
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:13,780
Even though there were no people to

117
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,390
photograph I said that those houses told

118
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:20,040
the stories of their owners. Those spaces

119
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:23,230
reminded me of how much my life turned

120
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:26,700
into public during the war.

121
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:31,800
I have no personal life back then, my

122
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,460
private one was like dead. As a photo

123
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,100
editor my phone was ranking constantly,

124
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:41,910
starting as early as 5 or 6 a.m,

125
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:45,840
sometimes until hours after midnight, my

126
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,700
computer screen was full of messages

127
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:50,310
from everybody requesting photographs

128
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:53,700
from all AP offices, like all over

129
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:54,390
the world.

130
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:57,180
I had to stare at photographs on the

131
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:00,860
computer screen every day for 34 days.

132
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,570
Images of the injured, the dead, the

133
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:06,450
destruction, people crying the death of

134
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:08,090
their loved ones,

135
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:10,380
heartbreaking photographs of people I

136
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:13,860
related to. The war had forcibly turned

137
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:16,680
my life from private to a public one, the

138
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:20,480
same as for those spaces.

139
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:35,480
So I took photographs of few houses and

140
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:40,010
I then formed a series of photographs

141
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:47,060
that I titled 'Abandoned spaces'. I only

142
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:50,300
shot that over a few days but I felt it

143
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:52,040
was my way of reconciling with

144
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:56,360
photography. After that project I started

145
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,100
working on the Lebanese issues,

146
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,230
especially those related to women's rights,

147
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:02,900
until I decided to start researching the

148
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:11,840
subject of the missing. Saree Makdisi,

149
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,430
professor of English and Comparative

150
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:15,140
Literature at the University of

151
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:19,190
California, Los Angeles. The Lebanese

152
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:21,980
civil war began in 1975 and ended in

153
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:25,520
1990. It was a war over the distribution

154
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,350
of power among it between different

155
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:29,180
sectarian groups in the country or

156
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:31,460
really more specifically the

157
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:33,320
distribution of power among the elites

158
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,890
of different sectarian groups. The

159
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:39,020
principal axis of tension in the war was

160
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,970
between those who wanted to maintain the

161
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:43,130
older system of Maronite hegemony, the

162
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:45,770
privileged Maronite Catholic elites and

163
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:47,540
those who wanted to make the political

164
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:49,690
system more representative of and

165
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:51,830
accountable to the population of the

166
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:52,580
entire country.

167
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,620
So although it's often depicted as a

168
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:57,050
religious war or war over religion or

169
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:59,210
even a war between religious communities

170
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:02,090
or sects, it really was a struggle over

171
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:04,360
the distribution of power.

172
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,070
Despite this, fighting and displacement

173
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:09,350
of population did often blend into

174
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:11,300
tensions between different sectarian

175
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,370
communities and at times degenerated

176
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:16,670
into blind inter-communal violence. On

177
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:19,250
top of killed and injured there were

178
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:22,100
thousands of kidnappings that took place

179
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,890
during the war. The kidnappings were

180
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:27,610
often done on the basis of one's

181
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:31,010
communal or religious identity because

182
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,229
Lebanese identity documents officially

183
00:08:33,229 --> 00:08:35,870
list your religion if you're caught by

184
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:38,690
the wrong kind of party and you have the

185
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:39,390
wrong kind of ID,

186
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:40,830
you could be in trouble and that

187
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:42,860
happened a lot of people during the war.

188
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:46,020
The kidnappings were sometimes for

189
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:46,950
ransom,

190
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:49,470
sometimes for murder, sometimes for

191
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:51,840
execution and torture, sometimes for

192
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,880
reprisal, sometimes for vengeance and sometimes

193
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,430
for personal vendettas. So it's not clear

194
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:58,400
necessarily why somebody's kidnapped,

195
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:01,110
very often people would disappear and

196
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:02,130
that would be that nobody would know

197
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:04,860
what happens to them. Everybody knows

198
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,960
somebody who was kidnapped. I personally

199
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,970
know a neighbor of ours who was

200
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:10,770
kidnapped and then held for a few days

201
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:12,990
and then released. I have a relative who

202
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:15,690
was kidnapped and released I think the

203
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:18,450
same day and one of my closest childhood

204
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:20,400
friends was kidnapped with his parents

205
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:24,600
and never heard from again. And of course

206
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,550
there's a big difference between killed

207
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:28,170
and wounded and those who had

208
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:30,600
disappeared because killed or wounded I

209
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,700
mean awful as that is of course for the

210
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,200
people themselves and for their families

211
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,180
and friends and so forth at least you

212
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,680
know what happened, whereas people who

213
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,800
disappear you don't know what

214
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,450
happens to them so there's no closure,

215
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:45,860
there's no resolution for the trauma.

216
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:48,240
It's important to point out that those

217
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,950
responsible for the kidnappings for the

218
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:53,220
most part remain very close to power in

219
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:55,380
Lebanon given the country's amnesty law.

220
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,810
Right after the war, they've been

221
00:09:57,810 --> 00:09:59,910
absolved of guilt and responsibility and

222
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:01,620
there has never been a kind of inquest or a

223
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:02,460
sort of Truth and Reconciliation

224
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:05,640
committee and certainly nobody's been

225
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,990
held accountable for the crimes they

226
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:09,260
committed during the war so basically

227
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:12,330
the fates of those that disappeared in

228
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:16,370
the war has never been resolved.

229
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,970
During the war of 2006, many

230
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:26,860
international photographers and

231
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:29,470
journalists came to Lebanon to cover the

232
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:32,589
event. The country was full of foreign

233
00:10:32,589 --> 00:10:36,160
press. The war lasted for 34 days and the

234
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,019
press was doing a superb work, like a

235
00:10:38,019 --> 00:10:41,199
super work covering the direct events,

236
00:10:41,199 --> 00:10:45,009
the bombardment, tires??, something I could

237
00:10:45,009 --> 00:10:48,009
have never done. When the ceasefire was

238
00:10:48,009 --> 00:10:51,040
agreed on in August 14, the media kept

239
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,439
documenting the direct aftermath for few

240
00:10:53,439 --> 00:10:55,540
weeks before the country was empty again

241
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:59,259
and the people who were left behind were

242
00:10:59,259 --> 00:11:01,360
left to suffer with their own new

243
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,999
realities. That was my case too, all the

244
00:11:03,999 --> 00:11:05,620
international photographers had left

245
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:08,439
they all had their month off to rest but

246
00:11:08,439 --> 00:11:12,069
I was the one who had to stay behind and

247
00:11:12,069 --> 00:11:14,230
the country that was destroyed was the

248
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:18,069
one I lived in. It was like the horror

249
00:11:18,069 --> 00:11:22,529
never ended. This is the same case for

250
00:11:22,529 --> 00:11:25,839
the Civil War and all the wars conflict,

251
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:27,910
clashes that happened since I was born.

252
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:32,370
The media leaves when those ends so

253
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:35,439
through my photographs I try to tell the

254
00:11:35,439 --> 00:11:38,110
stories of people who are left behind,

255
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:41,050
those whose stories did not specifically

256
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:45,730
interest the mainstream media. The issue

257
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:47,290
of the missing and kidnapped

258
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:50,709
haven't been covered much lately so in my

259
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:53,139
project I wanted to dig deeper in the

260
00:11:53,139 --> 00:11:58,400
story.

261
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:04,640
I met Ida and Leda Jada at the tents

262
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,279
during a gathering for Odette Salem? who

263
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:10,670
was killed when a car hit her. But that

264
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:13,130
was the mother of two young men and his

265
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:16,580
sister. Her son and her daughter were

266
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:21,260
kidnapped in the 80s. The families were

267
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:24,170
all devastated, it was yet another mother

268
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:26,420
who had died before receiving any

269
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:33,600
information on the fate of her children.

270
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:40,310
The day of the funeral her sister allowed us to

271
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:43,880
visit Odette's home for a few minutes. As I

272
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,580
went from one room to another, her home

273
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:48,440
looked as if it was untouched for

274
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:52,029
decades. Inside her daughter's closet

275
00:12:52,029 --> 00:12:55,460
hang a life-sized poster of a male model,

276
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:58,910
on the bottom of the closet next to shoe

277
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:04,400
boxes lay some old dolls and on the wall

278
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,010
was hanging a black-and-white poster of

279
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:12,050
the Eagles. Those are items that people

280
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:15,890
throw away daily while they have no

281
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:19,040
value for us they act as one of the main

282
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,230
evidence for the one-time presence of

283
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:25,670
the missing person. The photographs of

284
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:28,310
the belongings gave much more depth to

285
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:36,830
the project. Three years later in 2012,

286
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:39,680
I called Lina to ask her if she and her

287
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,330
mother would allow me to take their

288
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:44,860
photograph and tell their story.

289
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:48,440
Normally, with a journalist, I am a bit reserved

290
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:52,640
I don't talk much. But with Dalia, because I felt that she is

291
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:56,460
just like us, and with our friends

292
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:59,680
we started chatting with her and did not feel that there is a barrier.

293
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,120
She is reasonable, not the type that will communicate our message inaccurately.

294
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,800
Because some people just want to get the soop

295
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,580
but with Dalia, no, I didn't feel she is like that.

296
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:12,400
But then after years and years have gone by

297
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:16,359
We felt that the media stopped doing anything.

298
00:14:16,359 --> 00:14:20,919
It felt like we are just filling pages in newspapers.

299
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,620
No one is listening to us and no one is doing anything

300
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:27,180
Not all media is the same. Some do damage with their news

301
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:30,340
and some help you

302
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:35,400
and some just wait to get the scoop

303
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:40,420
but we are interested in honest journalism because our issue is a humanitarian one.

304
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,820
But after a few years there are no more scoops

305
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:47,880
The scoop was just at the beginning

306
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:51,600
then they need to start doing things

307
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,060
I don't know but we didn't feel that

308
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:57,660
they wrote a lot in the newspapers.

309
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:01,140
Everyone writes and that's it

310
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:05,940
try to tell the stories of people who

311
00:15:05,949 --> 00:15:08,499
are left behind those who stories did

312
00:15:08,499 --> 00:15:10,839
not specifically interest the mainstream

313
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:14,589
media. The issue of the missing and

314
00:15:14,589 --> 00:15:17,109
kidnapped haven't been covered much lately.

315
00:15:17,109 --> 00:15:20,709
So in my project I wanted to dig deeper

316
00:15:20,709 --> 00:15:23,919
in the story - to learn more about the

317
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:25,809
different narratives behind the missing

318
00:15:25,809 --> 00:15:28,389
and the kidnapped. At the beginning I

319
00:15:28,389 --> 00:15:30,459
photographed portraits for example of

320
00:15:30,459 --> 00:15:32,289
the families, then I learned about the

321
00:15:32,289 --> 00:15:32,949
belongings

322
00:15:32,949 --> 00:15:34,929
they kept of the victims. With each

323
00:15:34,929 --> 00:15:37,359
family a different story the same pain

324
00:15:37,359 --> 00:15:39,850
of course but a different story and

325
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:42,999
details. After a month or two I got in

326
00:15:42,999 --> 00:15:44,889
touch with Benjamin Chesterton from Duck

327
00:15:44,889 --> 00:15:45,809
rabbit.

328
00:15:45,809 --> 00:15:49,209
We emailed back and forth and he was

329
00:15:49,209 --> 00:15:52,920
interested in my way of photographing.

330
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,900
I told him about the project of the

331
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,820
missing and few months later he decided

332
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,560
to come to Beirut and work with me on

333
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:04,070
that project for the BBC. For three days

334
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:07,380
Benjamin and I met mothers of victims of

335
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,320
enforced disappearances.

336
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:15,000
We met with NGO people MPs, ex-militia

337
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,850
members, women telling about the last

338
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:20,010
time they saw their children, their

339
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:23,040
husbands. They talked about their

340
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,170
continuous struggle and their only wish

341
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:28,820
to know the fate of their loved ones.

342
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:34,050
Mostly indicated?? with the families were

343
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:37,250
conducted in their mother tongue and

344
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:39,780
obviously Dalia would conduct those

345
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:41,930
interviews and I would assist with

346
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:47,160
really helping her to shape them. In a

347
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,290
sense in that situations it's hardest for

348
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:51,060
her because she's got to bring a

349
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:53,100
stranger into a situation, is very

350
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,920
painful for those women and if you read

351
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,260
the interviews that she conducted with

352
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:01,110
them for this project, they talked about

353
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:04,440
each time how the wind is opened up and

354
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,890
that is an extremely difficult thing for

355
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:10,770
anybody to do repeatedly in front of

356
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:13,880
journalists or anyone.

357
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:31,070
Aida's husband Kamal was kidnapped in

358
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:34,460
1985 along with his nephew Simran as

359
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:37,420
they were coming back from their work.

360
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:42,210
They never heard of them again. So along

361
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:44,220
with a man the mother of my friend I

362
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:47,430
visited them at home. Aidah refused to

363
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:48,270
be photographed

364
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:53,100
even after Aman insisted. I looked for

365
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,870
the best place to take the photograph of

366
00:17:54,870 --> 00:18:02,400
Lena. There were two chairs that were

367
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,920
placed on each side of a small table and

368
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,710
on the wall behind them a painting was

369
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:11,700
hanging. Aida brought a framed portrait

370
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:14,460
of her husband from the 80s and placed

371
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,480
it on the table

372
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,760
along with his pipe.

373
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:21,480
I said I do not want to be photographed, initially.

374
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,820
When I brought Kamal's picture and put it

375
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:26,490
it wasn't there then, Kamal's picture

376
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:30,960
and I put the pipe that Kamal used to smoke.

377
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:37,400
He liked to smoke and I liked the smell of the ... pipe,

378
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,400
the tobacco for the pipe.

379
00:18:41,179 --> 00:18:47,009
As I moved the sofa facing the two seats

380
00:18:47,009 --> 00:18:48,929
and stood behind it to have more space

381
00:18:48,929 --> 00:18:51,840
in distance, Aida

382
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,330
suddenly sat on the seat and told me to

383
00:18:54,330 --> 00:19:04,080
take the photograph. We were all shocked

384
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,320
Aman, Lena and myself. She had resisted

385
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,419
being photographed for over an hour

386
00:19:09,419 --> 00:19:12,629
while we were having tea earlier so I

387
00:19:12,629 --> 00:19:16,049
just clicked two frames and then her

388
00:19:16,049 --> 00:19:18,559
daughter sat for the portrait after her.

389
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:20,669
It is what I love about this image there is

390
00:19:20,669 --> 00:19:23,100
a huge amount of respect. Dalia is not

391
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:26,960
trying, she's not trying too hard and

392
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:31,710
it's it's subtle and it's poetic, so

393
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:33,899
talked about the idea of beauty she does

394
00:19:33,899 --> 00:19:35,759
and it's a beautiful image it took thoughtful

395
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:38,090
image.

396
00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:52,629
So anyway when I developed the films and

397
00:19:52,629 --> 00:19:54,759
scanned them, I sent Aida's photographs to

398
00:19:54,759 --> 00:19:58,479
the jedis?? by email. Both of them thought

399
00:19:58,479 --> 00:20:02,909
that the photograph looked very empty.

400
00:20:02,909 --> 00:20:06,639
Amal and her daughter on the other side

401
00:20:06,639 --> 00:20:09,039
thought it was beautiful and represented

402
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:12,549
her situation and the emptiness in her

403
00:20:12,549 --> 00:20:17,200
life. I explained by email also that this

404
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,419
was exactly what I was aiming at, the

405
00:20:19,419 --> 00:20:21,039
empty chair that was supposed to be

406
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:24,129
occupied by the husband had she not been

407
00:20:24,129 --> 00:20:27,669
kidnapped. Instead a photograph of him

408
00:20:27,669 --> 00:20:30,580
from the 80s sitting on the table as

409
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:33,879
if time falls for him after he was

410
00:20:33,879 --> 00:20:41,259
kidnapped. In the photograph he's smiling

411
00:20:41,259 --> 00:20:45,179
when life was better for the family and

412
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:49,179
by coincidence he was looking at his

413
00:20:49,179 --> 00:20:49,960
wife Heida

414
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:53,259
who has aged and was looking at me with

415
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:57,400
sad eyes thirty years after his kidnapping

416
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,960
I felt that it was obvious that the house does't have

417
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,480
life, you know, the picture.

418
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:13,120
You see what I mean. It's supposed to be Kamal sitting next to me and I am sitting like that

419
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:17,940
looking at the camera, you see what I mean.

420
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:20,500
I didn't feel

421
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:28,040
I don't know how to say it.
I didn't feel that it has....[life].. yes.

422
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:32,540
There is the empty chair. We didn't

423
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,680
consider it as this chair

424
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:38,560
is for the missing person.
For Kamal

425
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,580
Just part of the decoration.

426
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:43,840
But they took notice of this.

427
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:47,780
The empty wall as well.

428
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:52,580
They look at the picture differently from how we look at it as if you are flipping the page.

429
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:57,140
They look at where the eyes are looking

430
00:21:57,140 --> 00:22:01,840
The picture, the portrait on the table.

431
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,340
The eyes and everything

432
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:07,460
We do not look at it like that. Maybe

433
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:10,500
because we are living it. Ok it will just go by

434
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:14,100
Dalia took a very nice picture becuase

435
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:18,800
You can feel that the picture reflects on all her emotions

436
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:23,980
For a number of year. Her feelings are with the view of the house and the ... because it is missing something

437
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:28,400
Her life in the house. 
Dalia took a good picture because

438
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:30,990
She captured the idea

439
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:33,820
So there's nothing to be pitied there, Dalia

440
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:36,340
is a strength and a defiance and an

441
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:39,220
anger mixed with a little bit of hope

442
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:46,290
that each day is getting stuffed out.

443
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:48,240
So it's always like a privilege and a

444
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,020
pleasure to be in such a place as a

445
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:54,630
welcome guest very much as a welcome

446
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:57,660
guest, but professionally you're thinking

447
00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:02,640
what do I need and really that welcome

448
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,480
and that trust it's only worth it for

449
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,720
them if you do a good job, if you tell

450
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:12,300
their story properly. It's only worth the

451
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:14,460
pain that they have to go through when

452
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:17,080
they open themselves up if you meet that

453
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:21,000
with a professionalism and a determination to get it right.

454
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:25,540
You leave the person at ease when you take the picture

455
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:28,640
Can you please repeat that as I was talking as well

456
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:32,300
but if you don't want to say anything don't worry, but if you do..

457
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:35,320
What was the question?

458
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:41,360
You get the person thinking whether she wants to be photographed or not. Yes

459
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:45,500
Then one gets excited and sits at the chair to be photographed.

460
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:52,520
She knows how to get people on board.

461
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:55,350
that taking the time to get to know

462
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:58,050
people, going back again and again and

463
00:23:58,050 --> 00:23:59,850
again and showing that we care about

464
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:02,550
them and their problems and that we're

465
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:04,800
not only here to photograph them and

466
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,590
leave but that we are really trying to

467
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:10,470
make a change and then their cause has

468
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:14,760
become ours. This makes people open up

469
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,700
and trust us and let us into their life.

470
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:19,200
The family tell the stories of the

471
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,660
missing loved ones, they show their

472
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:24,450
belongings that they had guarded for

473
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:27,480
decades, they share all the details and

474
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,280
evidence they had collected throughout

475
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:32,730
the years. I had understood the value of

476
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:35,280
those belongings and photograph them as

477
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:40,200
precious relics. Each item alone. I was

478
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,180
thinking about what I wanted to say

479
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:44,370
particularly in relation to you as the

480
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:47,790
audience looking at a photo and how you

481
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:51,120
might respond to that photo and the

482
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,190
thing that I wanted to tell you was that

483
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:56,669
the danger of a photo is that it holds

484
00:24:56,669 --> 00:24:59,190
someone in time, in moment, it kind of

485
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:02,909
says this is this is it, right, and life

486
00:25:02,909 --> 00:25:04,710
is not like that because it's much more

487
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:08,249
complex and sometimes we need Dalia to

488
00:25:08,249 --> 00:25:10,139
have sat down with the women and just

489
00:25:10,139 --> 00:25:12,749
hear what they think and it kind of

490
00:25:12,749 --> 00:25:14,309
takes away a lot of the formality of

491
00:25:14,309 --> 00:25:16,440
what you're seeing and your feelings

492
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:19,710
about what you're seeing in fact what I

493
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:21,690
would say is her interview with the

494
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:24,059
women in many ways is actually more

495
00:25:24,059 --> 00:25:26,549
humanizing than the photograph itself

496
00:25:26,549 --> 00:25:29,669
and that's something really interesting

497
00:25:29,669 --> 00:25:39,720
to reflect on. There is a violence in

498
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,700
photography that on one level, perhaps

499
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,590
violence is the wrong word, but there's a

500
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:45,600
tension when a person brings a camera or

501
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,070
a smartphone up to their eye there's

502
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:49,200
immediately the photographer and the

503
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,879
photographed and there will be the

504
00:25:50,879 --> 00:25:52,619
audience or the viewer as well at some

505
00:25:52,619 --> 00:25:54,809
point and the most powerful stakeholder

506
00:25:54,809 --> 00:25:56,489
in those three-way relationships is

507
00:25:56,489 --> 00:26:00,480
almost never the subject. This is why this

508
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,070
class interview are setup the way they

509
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:03,539
are between the photographer our

510
00:26:03,539 --> 00:26:05,940
subjects and the audience is to explore

511
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:08,279
that tension and then it for us to

512
00:26:08,279 --> 00:26:09,869
reflect on our relationships with the

513
00:26:09,869 --> 00:26:11,369
world, we'll bring the camera up to our

514
00:26:11,369 --> 00:26:13,200
eye and make the world our subject and

515
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,749
listen to Dalia's conversation one of

516
00:26:15,749 --> 00:26:17,239
the first things that's apparent is that

517
00:26:17,239 --> 00:26:19,230
telling someone else's story is a

518
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:21,600
speculative endeavor right, I mean, Dalia

519
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,309
and Benjamin asked permission of their

520
00:26:23,309 --> 00:26:24,809
subjects in the full knowledge that they

521
00:26:24,809 --> 00:26:27,289
might well and do sometimes say no.

522
00:26:27,289 --> 00:26:29,429
Dalia talks to people agreeing to have

523
00:26:29,429 --> 00:26:31,289
their photographs made years after she

524
00:26:31,289 --> 00:26:33,119
asked and we begin to get a sense of the

525
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:34,499
negotiation that has to take place

526
00:26:34,499 --> 00:26:36,450
between the subject and the photographer

527
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:37,799
and the importance of trust in that

528
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:40,109
relationship. I said in the introduction

529
00:26:40,109 --> 00:26:42,690
that what Dalia's work will come to mean

530
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:45,029
is interesting, but that applies to all

531
00:26:45,029 --> 00:26:47,070
our images it's difficult if not

532
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:48,480
impossible for us to know what our

533
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,159
images will come to mean in future

534
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:52,559
contexts, what their values might be and

535
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:55,710
to whom, which is problematic when we've

536
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:57,299
negotiated or built a trust relationship

537
00:26:57,299 --> 00:26:59,669
with our subjects, I mean what is it that

538
00:26:59,669 --> 00:27:01,230
we promised what is their understanding

539
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:03,149
and what exactly do they give their

540
00:27:03,149 --> 00:27:07,019
consent for? The subject has to agree to

541
00:27:07,019 --> 00:27:09,239
be vulnerable and not just once not just

542
00:27:09,239 --> 00:27:10,999
at the point of the shutter release.

543
00:27:10,999 --> 00:27:12,529
The photograph may never be seen within

544
00:27:12,529 --> 00:27:14,570
the context it was actually taken, the

545
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:16,070
chances are it will live in many

546
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:18,109
different contexts even simultaneously

547
00:27:18,109 --> 00:27:20,389
and its meaning might well shift with

548
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:21,769
each audience in each time the subject

549
00:27:21,769 --> 00:27:24,859
will be vulnerable again. The prison

550
00:27:24,859 --> 00:27:26,840

551

session says we all have a right to

553
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,539
carry a camera but that doesn't mean we

554
00:27:32,539 --> 00:27:34,749
have a right to photograph all the people.

555

00:27:37,399 --> 00:27:39,169
you to put down your own moral markers

557
00:27:39,169 --> 00:27:41,029
take a metacognitive view of your

558
00:27:41,029 --> 00:27:42,350
practice, think this through:

559
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:45,169
what is your code of ethics? Make your

560
00:27:45,169 --> 00:27:47,330

00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:49,730
