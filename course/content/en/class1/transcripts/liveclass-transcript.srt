00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,460
Hello I'm Jonathan Worth and as well as
being a freelance photographer,

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:08,060
I'm also a Senior Researcher at Newcastle
University's Open Lab in the UK.

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:12,320
The interviews you're about to hear are part
of a series that along with the web-platform

4
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,400
and connected classes, seeks to
create a space for a more

5
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:18,192
critical engagement with visual storytelling.

6
00:00:18,192 --> 00:00:20,939
The following audio montage is of several

7
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:24,200
separate interviews including a
photographer, their subject

8
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,520
and someone who represents the audience.

9
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,520
The photographer is Dalia Khamissi and the subjects are

10
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:33,180
Aida Geadah, her daughter Lena and Jeanette Youssef.

11
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:37,840
The audience perspective is provided by documentary
filmmaker Benjamin Chesterton.

12
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:41,880
Dalia is a Lebanese photographer who began work as the Beirut Photo Editor

13
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,720
for the Associated Press back in 2005

14
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:49,240
Aida, Lena and Jeanette are all subjects from Dalia's project  "The Missing".

15
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:53,840
Benjamin is production director and co-founder of the film production company DuckRabbit.

16
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:57,600
His background was as a documentary producer for the BBC World Service

17
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:01,080
and his experiences of these, now blended audiences,

18
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:05,380
as well as his history with Dahlia's project, provide valuable insights.

19
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:09,180
Professor Saree Makdisi of the
University of California, Los Angeles

20
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,400
also provides some historical and
socio-political context.

21
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:16,940
In this edit of the interviews we're challenging ourselves to think in particular about

22
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:19,720
the theme "Evidence" and the question of believability.

23
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:21,660
Why should your audience believe you?

24
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:23,720
At the end of the session you'll be able to access the

25
00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:26,820
extended versions of individual interviews, along with a deep-dive

26
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:32,100
interview with a 2014 World Press Photo
competition winner, Rena Effendi.

27
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:36,280
In the meantime we invite you to interrogate, reflect on and discuss the content we've edited.

28
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:42,040
To become what the journalist Dan Gilmore refers to as 'active users of media', rather than passive readers.

29
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:44,540
We're used to photographs being evidential.

30
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:48,620
The first hundred years of photography's
history established its reputation as

31
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:51,960
trace representation, a quotation from appearances.

32
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,960
It was something that required a human to make, but once the shutter was released

33
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,980
the process became a chemical one.

34
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,040
Even still, the photograph represents a point of view,

35
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,040
both literally and figuratively.

36
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:05,820
We have to choose how to edit the world.

37
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:11,200
We discern between important visual information and extraneous visual noise,

38
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:16,120
and we have to do this within messy,
chaotic and often very personal situations.

39
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:20,700
In Dalia Khamissy's project "The Missing" we hear how she tells the stories of people

40
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,940
through their homes, through their possessions and through their relatives.

41
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:27,840
We hear from those relatives what the process of sharing their stories is like,

42
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,620
and we hear the
filmmaker Benjamin Chesterton describe

43
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:33,340
the responsibilities of the professional
storyteller.

44
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,560
Although many of us are photographers,

45
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,840
we are the audience now and
as such it pays us to reflect on

46
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,900
what moves us and to reflect on why?

47
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,820
How can photographs of absence retain any evidential currency?

48
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,180
What case is being built? What is the overall narrative?

49
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,760
Is the historical account an impartial one?

50
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:56,460
What is Dalia's motivation and how have her outlets for that motivation evolved?

51
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,400
What is the motivation of the subjects?

52
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,680
Why do they agree to submit to such a
painful procedure?

53
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,420
What or who is the common ground for these various stakeholders?

54
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:12,580
And critically for us as image makers and visual storytellers, in a world where everyone in this piece can

55
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:14,980
theoretically publish their own story -

56
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:20,180
what are Dalia's various roles, 
and those of the 21st century photographer?

57
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,159
Other questions will appear in the transcripts

58
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:25,849
and you'll have your own so please add
them, add your answers, add your comments

59
00:03:25,849 --> 00:03:30,420
and add your notes into the platform as
you listen.

60
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,540
[Dalia] Merhaba my name is Dalia Khamissi and I'm a photographer based in Beirut Lebanon.

61
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:42,700
Since 2010 I have been working on the estimated 17,000 missing and forcibly disappeared

62
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:47,440
from the 1975 to 1990 Lebanese civil war.

63
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:53,000
I was 2 years old and this civil war started 
and around 17 when it ended.

64
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:57,780
The town where I was born and raised suffered mostly during the last few years of the war.

65
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:01,540
I remember that sometimes suddenly the bombing would start again

66
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:05,380
and that we would run back to the house for shelter.

67
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,900
I actually remember days where

68
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:11,960
I witnessed bombs falling less than 30
meters away from the building

69
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:16,540
I remember my sister and I screamed in panic as we
were stuck in the corridor

70
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:22,960
not knowing where to hide as the sound of the bombs was getting nearer.

71
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,880
[Saree] The Lebanese civil war began in 1975 
and ended in 1990.

72
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,160
[Jonathan] Saree Makdisi

73
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,880
[Saree] It was a war over the distribution of power among and between

74
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,960
different sectarian groups in the
country or really, more specifically,

75
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:41,320
the distribution of power among the elites
of different sectarian groups.

76
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:47,120
Fighting and displacements of population during
the war did often blend into tensions between

77
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:51,479
different sectarian communities
and at times degenerated into blind

78
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,280
inter-communal violence.

79
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,040
Exact numbers as to how many people were killed are not exactly clear

80
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,280
because really there was
no state to keep accurate records of

81
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,780
these kinds of things given the nature
of the war.

82
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:06,500
But, between 150 and 180 thousand people were killed.

83
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:10,260
This is in a population of around 3 million,
so it's pretty dramatic.

84
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,640
[Dalia] After I finished my photography years at university I knew

85
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:18,320
that I wanted to tell the stories of
people especially those who have

86
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:23,020
suffered Wars but, I was not prepared yet
to work on the wars I had lived.

87
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:29,319
In the summer of 2006 I witnessed the terrible
is really aggression on lebanon is

88
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:34,539
[News announcer]  "Israel's warning some 300,000 Lebanese to abandon their homes as it edges towards

89
00:05:34,539 --> 00:05:36,999
a full-on ground invasion of  Southern Lebanon"

90
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,460
[Dalia] I was working for The Associated Press in Beirut as a Photo Editor.

91
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:44,840
I did not photograph back then, but I saw the war

92
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,680
through the eyes of the other photographers in the field.

93
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:55,800
The Summer war was the most terrible I had lived.
I was older now not a child anymore and

94
00:05:55,810 --> 00:06:01,629
while my parents hid the graphic images
from us children, during the Civil War,

95
00:06:01,629 --> 00:06:06,740
as a photo editor I had to stare at
photographs on the computer screen every day.

96
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:13,320
Images of the injured, the dead, the destruction, people crying over the death of their loved ones.

97
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:17,120
Heartbreaking photographs of people I related to.

98
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:24,180
So during the war of 2006, many international photographers

99
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:27,880
and journalists came to Lebanon to cover the
events.

100
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:33,920
[mixed news announcers] ... Hezbolla fired a  wave of highly advanced rockets...

101
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:38,240
meanwhile the bombardment of Lebanon continues at least 30 Lebanese..."

102
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:44,260
[Dalia] The country was full of foreign press.
The war lasted for 34 days

103
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:47,440
and the press was doing superb work, like a super work.

104
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:53,520
In November 2006 I quit the AP four months after the beginning of the war and I was damaged

105
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:59,680
like totally damaged.
 I said at home most of the time after I quit.

106
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:06,260
Tears were falling from my eyes without me even
wanting to cry, as if my tears container

107
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:10,920
got very full and was now spilling over.

108
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,360
I went to the south of Lebanon the area

109
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:21,100
that suffered the most during the 2006
war and it was heavily bombarded.

110
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:29,220
Many villages and towns were flattened by the
bombing and I had seen those images

111
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:35,040
during the 2006 war but I had not seen them 
through my eyes.

112
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:41,800
That day I had my camera with me and I entered homes that were destroyed and abandoned.

113
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:49,020
The furniture was still there and what really shocked me

114
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:52,400
was how much the private homes of people had become public.

115
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,440
I mean anyone anyone could enter them because there were no more doors anymore

116
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,140
and obviously no more inhabitants.

117
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:09,340
On the floors lay clothes of those who lived
there, sometimes photographs,  belongings, keys.

118
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:14,180
Even though there were no people to
photograph I said that those houses

119
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:16,000
told the stories of their owners.

120
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:23,140
Those spaces reminded me of how much my life turned into public during the war.

121
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:27,920
The war had forcibly turned my life from private to a public one,

122
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:30,580
the same as for those spaces.

123
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:37,420
So I took photographs of few houses and
then I returned to take more and more

124
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:43,960
and I then formed a series of photographs that I titled "Abandon Spaces".

125
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:47,540
I felt it was my way of reconciling with photograph.

126
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:52,280
After that project I started working on the
Lebanese issues especially those related

127
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:57,320
to women's rights until I decided to start
researching the subject of the missing.

128
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:01,960
The issue of the missing is considered
one of the most difficult ones in Lebanon.

129
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,740
[Saree] There were thousands of
kidnappings that took place during the war.

130
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:12,980
The kidnappings were sometimes for
ransom, sometimes for murder,

131
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:16,880
sometimes for execution and torture. 
Sometimes for reprisal, sometimes for vengeance,

132
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:22,620
sometimes her personal vendettas. So it's
not clear necessarily why somebody's kidnapped.

133
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:25,800
But people would often disappear and then sometimes they'd be

134
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,640
released, sometimes somebody would pay
somebody and they'd get somebody released.

135
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:33,520
Very often people would be kidnapped, disappear and that would be that.

136
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,240
Nobody would know what what happens
to them.

137
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,740
Everybody knows somebody who was kidnapped

138
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:41,580
I personally know a neighbour of ours who was kidnapped and then held

139
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,260
for a few days and then released.

140
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:47,880
I have a relative who was kidnapped and released, I think the same day.

141
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:53,840
And one of my closest childhood friends was kidnapped with his parents and never heard from again.

142
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,760
And of course there's a big difference
between the casualties of killed and wounded

143
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,640
and those who are disappeared,
because killed or wounded I mean awful

144
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,760
is that is of course for the people
themselves and for their families and friends

145
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,200
and so forth, at least you know what happened.

146
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:13,100
Whereas people who just disappear you don't know what happens to them so there's no closure,

147
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:17,820
there's no resolution for the trauma. 
Those responsible for the kidnappings for the

148
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:24,640
most part remain very close to power in Lebanon given the country's amnesty law right after the war.

149
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,560
They've been absolved of guilt and responsibility.

150
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:31,260
Certainly nobody's been held accountable for the crimes they committed during the war.

151
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:38,720
So basically the fates of those that disappeared in the war has never been resolved.

152
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:47,100
[Dalia] So through my photographs I try to tell
the stories of people who are left behind.

153
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:52,060
Those whose stories do not specifically interest the mainstream media.

154
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:56,940
The issue of the missing and kidnapped haven't been covered much lately.

155
00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:02,140
So in my project I wanted to dig deeper
in the story -

156
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:06,280
to learn more about the different narratives behind the missing and the kidnapped.

157
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:09,880
At the beginning I photographed portraits, for example, of the families.

158
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:14,440
Then I learned about the belongings they kept of the victims.

159
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:21,400
With each family a different story, the same pain of course, but a different story and details.

160
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:26,420
In 2009 I met  Aida and Lena Gedeah.

161
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:31,880
Three years later in 2012 I called Lina the daughter of Aida to ask her

162
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:36,700
if she and her mother would allow me to take their photographs and tell their stories.

163
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:41,340
[Lina] Usually with journalists, I am cautious. I do not speak a lot.

164
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:46,820
But with Dalia, because I felt she was like us, like our friends, we started communicating with her and

165
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:52,860
I did not feel there will be a problem ... that she might convey the wrong message

166
00:11:53,020 --> 00:12:00,880
because there are people who follow the scoop… but with Dalia I did not feel that.

167
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:07,010
But then when many years passed, we felt that the media was not doing anything anymore.

168
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:16,740
As if we are filling the pages of the newspapers. Nobody was listening to us. Nobody was doing anything.

169
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:19,300
[Jeanette] Not all media is the same. You have media that hurt with their stories

170
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:23,150
and you other media that helps you,

171
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:33,040
and you have other media that maybe waits for the scoop to take it..

172
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:37,000
[Lina] But after few years, there is no more scoop.

173
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:43,520
The scoop is at the first phase, then afterwards,

174
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:51,400
there should be more work, that the media works more.

175
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:57,040
[Dalia] After a month or two  I got in touch with Benjamin Chesterton from DuckRabbit.

176
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:02,200
We emailed back and forth and he was interested in my way of photograph.

177
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,340
I told him about the project of the missing and two months later

178
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:10,240
he decided to come to Beirut and work with me on that project for the BBC.

179
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:18,220
For three days Benjamin and I met mothers of victims of enforced disappearances.

180
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:23,380
We met with NGO people, MPs, ex-militia members,

181
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:28,940
Women telling about the last time they saw their children, their husbands.

182
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:34,560
They talked about their continuous struggle and their only wish to know the fate of their loved ones.

183
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,860
[Benjamin] Most of the interviews with the families were conducted in their mother tongue.

184
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,880
And obviously Dalia would conduct those...

185
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:50,600
..conduct those interviews, and I would
assist with really helping her to shape them.

186
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,080
so what is the story that we're
telling here?

187
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:57,160
And it's obvious that the trust was there immediately with Dalia because it already existed.

188
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:02,580
But even so, bringing.. in, in a sense, in that
situation, it's hardest for her

189
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:08,500
because she's got to bring a stranger into a
situation that is very painful for those,

190
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:13,600
for those, for those women, and if you read
the interviews that she conducted with them,

191
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:19,620
for this project, they talked about each time how the wound is opened up

192
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:26,760
and that is an extremely, extremely difficult thing for anybody to do repeatedly

193
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,420
in front of journalists or any one.

194
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:40,700
[Aida] I thought Dalia had someone who was kidnapped, because of the strong enthusiasm she had,

195
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:44,200
the way she captures a photograph, and how she was very sensitive with those who had missing loved ones.

196
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:53,080
[Dalia] Really? Actually my father was detained for 3 days during the war, I was very young. But then I learned

197
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:56,140
there is an estimated 17,000 missing.
[Aida] Where?

198
00:14:56,140 --> 00:15:02,000
[Dalia] He was around Hamra, and then there was a swap of detainees… a very small militia.

199
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:10,300
Aida's husband Kamal was kidnapped in 1985 along with his nephew Sam Hahn, who was 22 back then,

200
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,220
as they were coming back from their work.

201
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:15,020
They never heard of them again.

202
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:17,913
They looked for them everywhere but in vain.

203
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:24,340
They were related to a friend of mine so along with Amal the mother and my friend I visited them at home.

204
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:29,860
Aida refused to be photographed at first, 
even after Amal insisted.

205
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:36,260
I looked for the best place to take the photograph of Lena  and then I found out that

206
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,240
the living room was the closest to a window.

207
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:43,160
There were two chairs that were placed on each side of a small table and

208
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:46,400
on the wall behind them a painting was hanging.

209
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:53,280
Aida brought a framed portrait of her husband from the 80s and placed it on the table along with his pipe.

210
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:58,000
[Aida] I did not want to be photographed at the beginning.

211
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:04,580
And then I brought the photo of Kamal and put it, it was not there then [on the table]

212
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:16,200
and then I put the pipe that Kamal smoked. He loved smoking and I loved the smell of the pipe’s tobacco.

213
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,700
We remembered him at that moment, during the photograph.

214
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:30,340
[Dalia] As I moved the sofa facing the two seats and stood behind it to have more space and distance,

215
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:35,500
Aida suddenly sat on the seat and told me to take the photograph.

216
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:39,460
We were all shocked, Amal, Lina and myself.

217
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:44,880
she had resisted being photographed for over an hour while we were having tea earlier

218
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:51,660
so I just clicked three frames and then her
daughter sat for the portrait after her.

219
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:56,680
[Lina] For us she was a journalist, we know that a lot of journalists hold cameras, so not a lot changed for us.

220
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:05,000
We trusted her because we knew her, we saw her, we saw her behaviour, she was not like people who…

221
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,100
I mean when someone did not want to be photographed she did not insist.

222
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:15,300
There are many people who do not like to be photographed,

223
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:22,200
so she took into consideration that there are people who do not like to be photographed.

224
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:28,160
[Dalia] When I'd developed the films and scanned them I sent Aida's photograph to the Gedea's by email.

225
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:33,320
Both of them thought that the photograph looked very
empty

226
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:40,580
Amal and her daughter on the other side, thought it was beautiful and represented her situation

227
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:43,660
and the emptiness in her life.

228
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:49,700
I explained by email also that this was exactly what I was aiming at,

229
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:53,540
the empty chair that was supposed to be occupied by the husband

230
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:55,700
had she not been kidnapped.

231
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:59,260
Instead a photograph of him from the 80s

232
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:05,690
sitting on the table, as is time froze for him 
after he was kidnapped.

233
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:12,620
In the photograph he's smiling when life was
obviously better for the family and

234
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:16,700
by coincidence he was looking at his wife Aida,

235
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:23,900
who has aged and who is looking at me
with sad eyes thirty years after his kidnapping.

236
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:29,799
[Aida] I felt that the house lacks life… the photograph...

237
00:18:29,799 --> 00:18:36,380
Kamal is sitting next to me and I am looking at the camera. I did not see that it [the photograph] had…

238
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:53,329
[Lina] life in it.
[Aida] Yes.

239
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:58,200
[Lina] The empty chair. For example we did not take into consideration

240
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:02,040
that this photo is supposed to be for the missing person…

241
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,460
[Aida] For Kamal.

242
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:08,380
[Lina] It is part of the decoration [of our house]. But this caught their eyes [the people who saw the image].

243
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:17,340
The wall was also empty… They looked at the photograph in a different way that we did.

244
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:28,020
They looked at the eyes, the portraits at the table. The eyes… we did not look at it this way,

245
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:35,780
maybe because we are living the situation…

246
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:44,080
[Jeanette] Dalia has taken a very beautiful photograph of your mother. As if the photograph is reflecting

247
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:49,100
all her feelings. Her feelings along with the house and the empty chair…

248
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,200
… as if her life partner is missing in the house

249
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:57,440
[Aida] Dalia photographed well; she captured the idea.

250
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:03,280
[Benjamin] So there's nothing to be pitied
there that is a strength and a defiance

251
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:10,020
and an anger, mixed with a little bit of
hope that each day is getting spuffed-out.

252
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:17,640
So it's always a privilege and a pleasure to be in such a place as a welcome guest,

253
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,840
very much as a welcome guest.

254
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:23,880
But professionally...  professionally you're thinking .. "What do I need?"

255
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:30,480
.. and really that welcome and that trust,

256
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:35,900
it's ..it's only worth it for them, if you do a good job..

257
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,900
if you tell their story properly.

258
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:43,060
It's only worth the pain, that they have to go through when they open themselves up

259
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:48,040
if you meet that with a professionalism and a determination to get it right.

260
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:53,080
So that's, that's my role as a storyteller.

261
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:59,240
[Dalia] I have never put pressure on the families to be photographed

262
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:01,397
I totally understand their sufferings

263
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:06,480
and how they still decide to hold on to some of the remaining privacy in their lives.

264
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:11,740
Some people tell me their stories and years later they accept I visit them for the photographs,

265
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:15,380
while others still did not decide and are still considering.

266
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:18,840
[Benjamin] I always like to think that when we sit with someone and we ask

267
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,360
them to tell something of themselves.

268
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:25,780
Most of the time I'm very clear I'll be using this material

269
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,760
and I think that's quite important as well and..

270
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:32,120
and part of just being a professional.

271
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:44,040
[Lina] Of course there is no regret that we were photographed. Would we do it again?

272
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:47,520
I am not sure.

273
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:51,720
There is no negative feeling but it is enough, we are tired.

274
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:57,640
You keep repeating the same story, every time to someone new.

275
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:04,500
Every time a university student wants to work on the subject, you have to tell the story again.

276
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:09,280
Of course he wants to do a project. 
But for us, it is enough.

277
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:12,340
[Benjamin] Obviously I'm very close to Dalia's project,

278
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:17,080
because I've sat with the women and I made a radio documentary and a film.

279
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:23,080
And, this morning I was thinking about what I wanted to say, particularly in relation to *you*

280
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,360
as the audience, looking at a photo

281
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,520
and how you might respond to that photo.

282
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:33,060
And the thing that I wanted to tell you was that,

283
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:36,180
the danger of a photo which I sort of, talked about earlier,

284
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:39,360
is that it holds someone in time, in moment.

285
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:43,520
it kind of says: "This is this is it",  right?

286
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,420
and life is not like that because it's much more complex

287
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,140
and people's feelings come and go and we have,

288
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:52,800
you know, waves, and up times and down times,

289
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:57,860
even anyone who's undergone trauma, 
and distress, and loss.

290
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:02,320
[Jeanette] Correct, this is what my mother used to say -

291
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:09,760
Every once in a while, someone comes and opens the wound that was healing.

292
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:15,600
It really bleeds, especially with the father and mother.

293
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:24,820
We are tired, but we will not lose hope, until we know the truth, we will keep on fighting.

294
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:31,180
[Lina] We do not think the photos are not leading to anything.

295
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:38,840
[Jeanette] I would keep repeating it, because it is a wall I want to keep knocking on.

296
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:42,680
Every time a journalist or a photographer approaches us,

297
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:45,170
especially Dalia who had promised she wants to photograph [the grave] in the mountains,

298
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:50,080
I will always accept, because the politicians do not hear our voices.

299
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:55,680
Hopefully the media manages to achieve something, we will always keep demanding,

300
00:23:55,800 --> 00:24:00,880
because there is no right that gets lost, when there is behind it people who keep insisting.

301
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:06,620
[Dalia] This project has taken me a long time to finish

302
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:08,640
and its a very mentally exhausting one.

303
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:12,020
Each story leaves me emotionally tired for days

304
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:16,780
and the fact that I would not settle on telling one side of the story

305
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:19,380
takes longer than it's been expected.

306
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:26,680
It is also a self-funded project so sometimes I need
to stop and work on my assignments

307
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:29,720
in order to survive and to save money to continue it.

308
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:35,840
But taking a long time to finish it gives me more time to think about it

309
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:42,180
and to brainstorm on how to make it, or take it,
 to a deeper level.

310
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:47,780
I do not have a deadline so I decided to allow myself to do this

311
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:52,320
until I have a project that I'm, very proud of.

312
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:54,940
[Benjamin]  We just have to keep asking questions.

313
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:59,300
We have to do that all the time, and challenge our own assumptions,

314
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:05,720
and sometimes we need Dalia to have sat down with the women and just hear what they think

315
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:09,140
and it kind of takes away a lot of the formality of what you're seeing

316
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:12,080
and your feelings about what you're seeing.

317
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:17,160
In fact, what I would say is her interview with the women, in many ways,

318
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:21,040
is actually more humanizing than the photograph itself

319
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:26,739
and that's something really interesting to.. to reflect on.

320
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:28,180
[Jonathan] Thank You Benjamin.

321
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:32,980
There are lessons here not only within
the stories contained of the missing,

322
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:36,840
but there are lessons here for us on how
visual storytelling is done,

323
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:40,820
what the dynamics are in that process and there
are pointers as to how we can become

324
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:44,960
more sophisticated, as both media-producers and media-consumers.

325
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,700
There is a tension in photography and 
there always has been.

326
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:52,160
An uneven distribution of power. 
A necessary vulnerability.

327
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:54,011
The basic premise is the same,

328
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:58,540
photography enables us to see the world through the eyes and lens of someone else

329
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:04,240
And there's an intimacy in that. When a person brings a camera or a smartphone up to their eye,

330
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,840
there is immediately the photographer and the photographed.

331
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:10,100
And there will be the audience or the viewer as well at some point,

332
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:13,840
and the most powerful stakeholder
in those three-way relationships

333
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,440
is almost never the subject.

334
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:18,660
The subject must agree to be vulnerable not just once,

335
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,520
not just at the point of the
shutter release

336
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,540
that photograph may never be seen within the context that it was actually taken.

337
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:28,720
The chances are it will live on in many different contexts
even simultaneously

338
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,633
and its meaning might well shift with each audience

339
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:35,060
and each time the subject will be vulnerable again.

340
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:38,340
It's why these class interviews
are set up the way they are

341
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:40,380
between a photographer, a subject and an audience.

342
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:45,020
It's to explore that tension, and then for us to reflect on our relationships with the world

343
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:48,580
when we bring the camera to our eye and make the world our subject.

344
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:51,060
And listening to Dalia's conversation,

345
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:56,280
one of the things that's apparent is that telling someone's story is a speculative endeavor.

346
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:59,700
Dalia and Benjamin asked permissions of their subjects

347
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:03,880
in the full knowledge that they
they might well and often do say "no".

348
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:08,060
Dahlia talks of people agreeing to have
their photographs made years after she's asked,

349
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:12,980
and we begin to get a sense of the negotiation that takes place between the subject and the photographer,

350
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:15,280
and the importance of trust in that relationship.

351
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:19,660
It's also interesting to consider what
Dalia's work will come to mean in the future,

352
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:23,330
and that's something that applies
to all our work - it's difficult if not

353
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:27,580
impossible for us to know what our
images will come to mean in future contexts

354
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:30,580
and what their values might be
and to whom.

355
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:35,540
Which might then be problematic when we've negotiated or built a trust relationship with our subjects.

356
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:38,560
I mean.. what what did we promise?
What is their understanding?

357
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:41,080
What exactly did they give their consent for?

358
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:44,960
Have we been transparent and honest about what we can and can't promise?

359
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:49,320
Because when the subject appears as an image,
 they're going to stand alone.

360
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:55,040
and we can't predict what the many possible feedback-loops (the consequences)

361
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:56,660
for that subject might be.

362
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:59,660
We all have a right carry a camera.

363
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:03,680
but does that automatically confer the right for us to photograph other people?

364
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:07,360
And if so then it's interesting to consider what the circumstances might be

365
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,420
where we would feel justified in doing so if say..

366
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:14,680
it made the subject feel uncomfortable,
distressed or scared.

367
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,160
This is one of the things that's so exciting about Dalia's work.

368
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:20,480
We don't know where it will lead,

369
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:24,680
but we know it's built on a foundation
of her asking those tough questions of herself

370
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:30,000
on a subject by subject basis,
exposing her own limitations and vulnerabilities

371
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,840
and we know that each image is a testament to that rigour and integrity.

372
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:37,279
It means that with each new layer of the evolving project, from

373
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:41,520
places, to artifacts, to portraits and
oral testimonies,

374
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,900
to a Facebook page and an Instagram feed, the project grows

375
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:48,640
as more and more people buy into that process that Dalia has set out.

376
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:54,000
So now is the time here in this session for you to put down your own moral markers.

377
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,940
To take a metacognitive view..  to step back and look at your own practice from a distance

378
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:03,080
and to spell out your best practice, your code of ethics.

379
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,119
You can also now access the deep dive materials

380
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:08,690
including the extended interviews and our interview with

381
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:13,099
World Press Photo winner Rena Effendi. In that
she reflects on all of the five course's

382
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:16,960
key questions, with reference to her work
and in particular, examples where

383
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,840
she's telling the stories of things that are
no longer there.

384
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:24,020
Don't forget to dig around in the class notes, investigate those hotspots and

385
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:28,500
see why particular parts of the conversations are being responded to and by whom.

386
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:29,659
Reach out, connect with people and

387
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:33,440
support those who can't get into a room of fellow students.

388
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:39,660
