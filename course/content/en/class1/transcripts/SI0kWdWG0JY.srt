00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:02,480
Hello I'm Jonathan Worth from the
Connected Academy.

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:06,380
Talking Pictures:Critical Engagement with Visual Storytelling is brought to you in

3
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:09,120
association with the World Press Photo Foundation.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,660
Today we're going to talk about a project that documents the families of people who are missing.

5
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,190
People who have been forcibly disappeared during a civil war that

6
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:21,840
lasted over an extended period of time. Its why we asked you to think about how you

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,840
might go about telling the story of something that isn't there in

8
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,300
preparation for this session.

9
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,580
You'll hear from a photographer and journalist who

10
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:33,360
spent multiple years making an oral
history and visual document of people

11
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,620
who've lost family members to a war in
the Middle East, that began over 40 years

12
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:42,140
ago, and probably thousands of miles away
from where you are now.

13
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:46,520
You might well question what the relevance of that is to you, but there are themes common to

14
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:51,180
all storytelling and so what we have
here is a particular case study, wherein

15
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:56,129
a lot of these themes crop up. So as a
way to think about some of those themes

16
00:00:56,129 --> 00:00:59,309
and make them into jumping-off points
for us to discuss in a connected notes

17
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:03,960
let me ask you: What are the different
vulnerabilities that you hear in this conversation?

18
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:06,880
With whom do the duties of care lie?

19
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:11,360
What are the responsibilities of both the photographer?

20
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,760
And the photographed?

21
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,620
And as audience what are our responsibilities?

22
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:20,200
and finally, do images function as evidence?

23
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:24,380
it sounds like an obvious one, but ask yourselves again, do images function as evidence?

24
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,080
And how do images and their meaning change over time?

25
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:31,340
So let me describe it again differently, with those questions as a frame:

26
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:37,960
You're about to listen to a female, Lebanese photographer who only ever knew war growing up.

27
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,240
She became a photo editor,

28
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:43,200
but burnt-out, through the effects of
looking at an unending stream of images

29
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,119
of war and its effects on her own people.
You'll hear how she made peace with

30
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:52,170
photography again and then when the war
ended in a journalist left, their work

31
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:58,500
done, she began to make her body of work.
It's a series of portraits of the people

32
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:03,149
like herself who were left behind.
There are three things I find particularly

33
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:08,879
fascinating about this conversation: what
is it that she's making? Her approach to

34
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:13,530
making it, and thirdly, what will 'it" come
to mean?

35
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:18,360
Each of her subjects is kind of an
archivist in a way carefully shepherding

36
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:22,209
the evidence of their loved ones. Those
scant everyday belongings of the people

37
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:27,909
who didn't come back; a toothpaste tube, a
pack of cigarettes, a poster. Each one a

38
00:02:27,909 --> 00:02:31,560
touchstone to the past and providing
another testament to their loved one.

39
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:38,340
And the old age of these people reminds us that, one can imagine a time, not so far

40
00:02:38,349 --> 00:02:41,560
from now, after the cigarettes have
disintegrated, and the houses have been

41
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:45,760
cleared. When all that will remain of
these people's stories will be Dalia's

42
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,760
project; "The Missing".

43
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:52,140
And you've got
Benjamin Chesterton, a male English,

44
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:55,629
ex-radio producer who doesn't speak Arabic and who has to produce two different

45
00:02:55,629 --> 00:02:59,859
versions of her project for radio and
web audiences, over a very short space of

46
00:02:59,859 --> 00:03:04,209
time with all is inherent technical
difficulties. And you're going to hear

47
00:03:04,209 --> 00:03:07,239
from the people whose stories they're
both trying to tell and just what that

48
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:11,000
process was like, and is like, for them to
go through.

49
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:15,420
Don't forget to share your notes in the platform comment on other people's notes

50
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,660
take time to pause,

51
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:21,120
reflect, review sections, go back through
the stuff you're not sure about,

52
00:03:21,129 --> 00:03:24,970
dig around in those networked class notes,
that's where the real value is -

53
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:27,200
in the conversation not the content,

54
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:31,320
and try to be supportive of the people who can't get into a room with other learners.

55
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,900
Merhaba.

56
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:40,740
My name is Dalia Khamissy and I'm a photographer based in Beirut, Lebanon.

57
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:47,100
Since 2010 I've been working on the
estimated 17,000 missing and forcibly

58
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:55,860
disappeared from the 1975 to 1990  Lebanese Civil War.

59
00:03:56,260 --> 00:04:01,580
The victims were from different political and religious backgrounds they came from all parts of

60
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:06,770
Lebanon and they were of all ages. The
kidnappers did not differentiate

61
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:16,320
between men or women at that time

62
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,170
But the missing was not exactly the first

63
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:22,560
project I did on the aftermath of wars
that I lived.

64
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:29,720
In the summer of 2006 I witnessed the terrible Israeli aggression on Lebanon as I was working

65
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:36,880
for the Associated Press and its office
in Beirut as a photo editor.

66
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:01,920
A year later I went to the south of Lebanon the area that suffered the most

67
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:10,290
during the 20o6 war and it was heavily bombarded. I had seen those images during

68
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:20,100
the 2006 war but I had not seen them through my eyes since then. That day I had my camera with me

69
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:23,700
I entered homes that were destroyed and abandoned.

70
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:30,260
What really shocked me was how much the private homes of people, had become public.

71
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:34,340
Anyone could enter them because there were no more doors anymore

72
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:38,160
and obviously no more inhabitants.

73
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:42,340
On the floors lay clothes of those who lived there,

74
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:45,820
sometimes photograph belongings
keys.

75
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:48,420
Even though there were no people to photograph

76
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,720
I said that those houses told the stories of their owners.

77
00:05:52,860 --> 00:06:00,800
Those spaces reminded me of how much my life turned into public during the war.

78
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,780
I have no personal life back then. My
private one was like, dead.

79
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:16,480
As a photo editor my phone was ringing constantly, starting as early as 5 or 6 am

80
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:19,300
Sometimes, until hours after midnight.

81
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:22,100
My computer screen was full of messages

82
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:28,520
from everybody requesting photographs
from all AP's offices, like, all over the world.

83
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:33,380
I had to stare at photographs on the computer screen everyday.

84
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,440
For 34 days.

85
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,640
Images of the injured, the dead, the

86
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:42,159
destruction, people crying the death of
their loved ones,

87
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:47,930
heartbreaking photographs of people I
related to. The war had forcibly turned

88
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:54,759
my life from private to a public one, the
same as for those spaces.

89
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:14,600
So I took photographs of few houses and
I then formed a series of photographs

90
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:18,400
that I titles  "Abandon Spaces".

91
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:24,360
I only shot that over few days, but I felt it

92
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,320
was my way of reconciling with
photography.

93
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,460
After that project I started working on the Lebanese issues

94
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,220
especially those related to women's rights,

95
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:40,080
until I decided to start researching the
subject of the missing

96
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:51,180
[Jonathan] Saree Makdisi,  Professor of English and Com parative Literature at the University of California Los Angeles.

97
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:57,120
[Saree] The Lebanese civil war began in 1975 and ended in 1990.

98
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,110
It was a war over the distribution
of power among and between different

99
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:05,360
sectarian groups in the country or
really, more specifically, the

100
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,760
distribution of power among the elites
of different sectarian groups.

101
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:15,060
The principal axis of tension in the war was between those who wanted to maintain the

102
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:19,840
older system of Maronite hegemony (the
privileged Maronite Catholic elites) and

103
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,760
those who wanted to make the political
system more representative of, and

104
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:27,970
accountable to, the population of the
entire country. So although it's often

105
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:32,710
depicted as a religious war or war over
religion or even a war between religious

106
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:38,430
communities or sects, it really was a
struggle over the distribution of power.

107
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:43,400
Despite this fighting and displacements
of population did often blend into

108
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:47,080
tensions between different sectarian
communities and at times degenerated

109
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:53,380
into blind, inter-communal violence. On
top of the killed and injured there were

110
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:58,990
thousands of kidnappings it took place
during the war the kidnappings were

111
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:05,080
often done on the basis of one's
communal or religious identity because

112
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:09,970
Lebanese identity documents officially
list your religion. If you're caught by

113
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:14,110
the wrong kind of party and you have the
wrong kind of id, you could be in

114
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:18,550
trouble and that happened to a lot of
people during the war. The kidnappings

115
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:23,560
were sometimes for ransom,
sometimes for murder, sometimes for

116
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:27,970
execution and torture, sometimes for
reprisal, sometimes revenge and sometimes

117
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:32,460
for personal vendettas. So it's not clear
necessarily why somebody's kidnapped

118
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:36,220
very often people would disappear and
that would be that. Nobody would know

119
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:41,050
what happens to them. Everybody knows
somebody who was kidnapped I personally

120
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:44,860
know a neighbor of ours who was
kidnapped and then held for a few days

121
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:49,750
and then released I have a relative who
was kidnapped and released I think the

122
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:53,100
same day
and one of my closest childhood friends

123
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:58,860
was kidnapped with his parents and never
heard from again. And of course there's a

124
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:02,519
big difference between killed and
wounded and those who had disappeared

125
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:07,050
because killed or wounded I mean awful
is that is of course for the people

126
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:10,410
themselves and for their families and
friends and so forth at least you know

127
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:15,360
what happened whereas people who dis
disappear you don't know what happens to

128
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:21,300
them so there's no closure there's no
resolution for the trauma. It's important

129
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:25,500
to point out that those responsible for
the kidnappings for the most part remain

130
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:30,329
very close to power in Lebanon given the
country's amnesty law right after the

131
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:34,980
war. They've been absolved of guilt and
responsibility.The fates of those that

132
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:39,720
disappeared in the war has never been
resolved and certainly nobody's been

133
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:44,420
held accountable for the crimes they
committed.

134
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:50,180
[Dalia] During the war of 2006 many
international photographers and

135
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:55,920
journalists came to Lebanon to cover the
events. The country was full of foreign

136
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:01,350
press. The war lasted for 34 days and the
press was doing superb work, like a

137
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:08,339
super work covering the direct events,
the bombardment, its horrors, something I could

138
00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:14,399
have never done.W hen the ceasefire was
agreed on in August 14 the media kept

139
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:18,570
documenting the direct aftermath for a
few weeks before the country was empty

140
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:24,120
again and the people who were left
behind were left to suffer with their

141
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:28,709
own new realities. That was my case too,
all the international photographers had

142
00:11:28,709 --> 00:11:34,709
left they all had them month off to
rest but I was the one who had to stay

143
00:11:34,709 --> 00:11:40,949
behind and the country that was destroyed was the one I lived in. It was like

144
00:11:40,949 --> 00:11:48,420
the horror never ended. This is the same
case for the Civil War and all the wars,

145
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:54,690
conflict, clashes that happened since I
was born. The media leaves when those end,

146
00:11:54,690 --> 00:12:01,220
so through my photographs I try to tell
the stories of people who are left

147
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:07,620
behind. Those who stories do not specifically interest the mainstream media.

148
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:12,980
The issue of the missing and kidnapped haven't been covered much lately,

149
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:17,100
so in my project I wanted to dig deeper in the story,

150
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:30,420
I met Aida and Lena Geadah at the tent
during a gathering for Odette Salem

151
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:36,059
who was killed when a car hit her. Odette was the mother of two young men and

152
00:12:36,059 --> 00:12:44,579
his sister her son and her daughter were
kidnapped in the 80s. The families were

153
00:12:44,579 --> 00:12:49,769
all devastated, it was yet another mother
who had died before receiving any

154
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:56,929
information on the fate of her children.

155
00:13:00,619 --> 00:13:07,199
The day of the funeral her sister allowed us to visit Odette's home for few minutes as I

156
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:11,759
went from one room to another, her home
looked as if it was untouched for

157
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:18,809
decades. Inside her daughter's closet
hang a life-size poster of a male model.

158
00:13:18,809 --> 00:13:27,720
On the bottom of the closet next to shoe
boxes lay some old dolls and on the wall

159
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:35,399
was hanging a black-and-white poster of
the Eagles. Those are items that people

160
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:42,360
throw away daily while they have no
value for us they act as one of the main

161
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:47,760
evidence for the one-time presence of
the missing person.

162
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:54,380
The photographs of the belonging gave much more depth to the project

163
00:13:57,180 --> 00:14:03,130
Three years later in 2012 I called Lina - after as she and her

164
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:07,440
mother would allow me to take their
photographs and tell their story.

177
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:29,860
[Dalia] Through my photographs I try to tell the stories of people who are left behind

178
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:36,940
those who's stories did not specifically
interest the mainstream media.

179
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:42,730
The issue of the missing and kidnapped haven't been covered much lately. So in my project I

180
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:47,440
wanted to dig deeper in the story, to, to
learn more about the different

181
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,730
narratives behind the missing and the
kidnapped. At the beginning I

182
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:55,630
photographed portraits for example, of
the families, then I learned about the

183
00:15:55,630 --> 00:16:00,400
belongings they kept of the victims.  With
each family a different story the same

184
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:04,600
pain of course but a different story and
details.

185
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:10,120
A fter a month or two I got in touch with
Benjamin Chesterton from DuckRabbit.

186
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:16,020
We emailed back and forth and he was
interested in my way of photography.

187
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:20,350
I told him about the project of the
missing and she was later decided to

188
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:25,820
come to Beirut and work with me on that
project for the  BBC.

189
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:32,640
For three days Benjamin and I met mothers of victims of enforced disappearances

190
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:41,200
we met with NGO people, MPs,  ex-militia
members, women telling about the last

191
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:46,360
time they saw their children, their
husbands, they talked about their

192
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:52,140
continuous struggle and their only wish
to know the fate of their loved ones.

193
00:16:54,480 --> 00:17:00,560
[Benjamin] Most of the interviews with the families were conducted in their mother tongue

194
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:05,280
and obviously Dalia would conduct those
interviews and I would assist with

195
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:09,200
really helping her to shape them.

196
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,940
In a sense, in that situations its hardest for her

197
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:16,420
because she's got to bring a
stranger into a situation is very

198
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:21,610
painful for those women and if you read
the interviews that she conducted with

199
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:27,850
them for this project they talked about
each time how the wind is opened up and

200
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:34,120
that is an extremely difficult thing for
anybody to do repeatedly in front of

201
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:37,200
journalists or anyone.

202
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:57,780
[Dalia] Aida's husband Kamal, was kidnapped in 1985 along with his nephew as

203
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:04,860
they were coming back from their work
they never heard of them again.

204
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:09,140
So along with Amal the mother of my friend I visited them at home.

205
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:16,940
Aida refused to be photographed even after Amal insisted. I looked for the best place

206
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:18,960
to take the photograph of Lena.

207
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:28,240
There were two chairs that were placed on each side of a small table

208
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:32,880
and on the wall behind them a painting was hanging.

209
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:38,120
Aida brought a framed portrait of her
husband from the 80s and placed it on the table

210
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:45,540
along with his pipe

211
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:51,300
[Aida] [Arabic to be translated]

212
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:57,740
[Arabic to be translated]

213
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:03,600
[Arabic to be translated]

214
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:13,980
[Dalia} As I move the sofa facing the two seats and stood behind it to have more space and distance

215
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:25,340
Aida suddenly sat on the seat and told me to take the photograph.

216
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:29,470
We were all shocked a man Lina and
myself.

217
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:34,659
She had resisted being photographed for
over an hour while we were having tea

218
00:19:34,659 --> 00:19:40,570
earlier so I just clicked through frames
and then her daughter said for the

219
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:42,140
portrait after her.

220
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:45,280
[Benjamin] This is what I love
about this image. There's a huge amount of respect.

221
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:52,460
Dalia's not trying, she's not
trying too hard here, and it's it's subtle and

222
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:56,590
it's poetic.
So we talked about the idea of beauty

223
00:19:56,590 --> 00:20:01,649
she does, and it's a beautiful image. Its a throughtful image.

224
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:19,800
[Dalia] So anyway when I developed the films and scanned them, I Aida's  photograph to the Geadahs by email.

225
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:26,240
Both of them thought that the photograph looked very empty.

226
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:32,370
Amal and her daughter on the other side
thought it was beautiful and represented

227
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:36,700
her situation and the emptiness in her
life.

228
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:41,040
I explained by email also that this

229
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:44,360
was exactly what I was aiming at the
empty chair that was supposed to be

230
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:51,000
occupied by the husband, had he not been
kidnapped. Instead a photograph of him

231
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:57,210
from the 80s sitting on the table. As
if time froze for him after he was kidnapped.

232
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:09,200
In the photograph he's smiling
when life was better for the family and

233
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:17,500
by coincidence he was looking at his
wife Aida, who has aged and was looking at me with sad eyes

234
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:25,160
thirty years after his kidnapping.

235
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:32,670
[Aida] [Arabic to be translated]

236
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:40,120
[Arabic to be translated]

237
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:55,070
[Arabic to be translated]

238
00:21:55,070 --> 00:22:01,510
[Arabic to be translated]

239
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:09,120
[Arabic to be translated]

240
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:16,520
[Arabic to be translated]

241
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:25,850
[Arabic to be translated]

242
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:33,740
[Arabic to be translated]

243
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:44,880
[Arabic to be translated]

244
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:49,980
[Arabic to be translated]

245
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:51,740
[Arabic to be translated]

246
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,860
[Benjamin] So there's nothing to be pitied there.

247
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:03,200
That is a strength and a defiance
and an anger mixed with a little bit of hope,

248
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:09,200
that each day is getting spuffed-out.

249
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:15,360
So it's always like a privilege and a
pleasure to be in such a place as a

250
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:20,970
welcome guest, very much as a welcome
guest.But professionally you're thinking

251
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:29,820
what do I need? And really, that welcome
and that trust it's only worth it for

252
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:35,640
them if you do a good job. If you tell
their story properly. It's only worth the

253
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:40,440
pain that they have to go through when
they open themselves up, if you meet that

254
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:45,900
with a professionalism and a
determination to get it right.

255
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:50,430
[Arabic]

256
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:55,320
[Arabic]

257
00:23:55,320 --> 00:24:00,330
[Arabic]

258
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:10,310
[Arabic]

259
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:11,080
[Arabic]

260
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:19,700
[Dalia] I believe that taking the time to get to know people.

261
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:24,120
Going back again and again and again and showing that you care about them and their

262
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:29,490
problems. And that we're not only here to
photograph them and leave, but that we

263
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:36,100
are really trying to make a change and
that their cause has become ours.

264
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:40,480
This  makes people open up and trust us and let us into their lives.

265
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:46,940
The families tell the stories of the missing loved ones, they show their belongings that they had

266
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:51,720
guarded for decades. They share all the
details and evidence they had collected

267
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:57,420
throughout the years. I had understood
the value of those belongings and

268
00:24:57,420 --> 00:25:02,940
photographed them as precious relics. 
Each item alone.

269
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:09,700
[Benjamin] I was thinking about what I wanted to say particularly in relation to you as the audience looking at a photo

270
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:14,220
and how you might respond to that photo

271
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:18,239
And the thing that I wanted to tell you was that, the danger of the

272
00:25:18,239 --> 00:25:24,239
photo is that it holds someone in time
in moment. It kind of says, this is this

273
00:25:24,239 --> 00:25:28,859
is it, right? And life is not like that,
because it's much more complex and

274
00:25:28,859 --> 00:25:34,439
sometimes we need Dalia to have sat
down with the women and just hear what

275
00:25:34,439 --> 00:25:38,099
they think and it kind of takes away a
lot of the formality of what you're

276
00:25:38,099 --> 00:25:43,529
seeing and your feelings about what
you're seeing. In fact what I would say

277
00:25:43,529 --> 00:25:48,779
is her interview with the women, in many
ways, is actually more humanising than

278
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:55,400
the photograph itself and that's
something really interesting to reflect on

279
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,940
[Jonathan] Thank you everyone.

280
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:04,520
There are lesson here, not only within the stories contained within The Missing

281
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:09,340
but there are lessons for us on how visual storytelling is done,

282
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:12,539
what those dynamics are in that process and pointers as to how

283
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:17,720
we can become more sophisticated as both media producers and media consumers.

284
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:21,899
There is a tension in photography and
there always has been, an uneven

285
00:26:21,899 --> 00:26:26,999
distribution of power. A necessary
vulnerability. The basic premise is the

286
00:26:26,999 --> 00:26:30,119
same Photography enables us to see the
world through the eyes and the lens of

287
00:26:30,119 --> 00:26:35,369
someone else, and there's an intimacy in
that. But when a person brings a camera

288
00:26:35,369 --> 00:26:39,359
or a smartphone up to their eye they,
there is immediately the photographer

289
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:43,799
and the photographed, and there will be
the audience or the viewer at some point

290
00:26:43,799 --> 00:26:47,909
and the most powerful stakeholder in
those three-way relationships is almost

291
00:26:47,909 --> 00:26:52,979
never the subject. The subject has to
agree to be vulnerable and not just once

292
00:26:52,979 --> 00:26:56,369
not just at the point of the shutter
release, that photograph may never be

293
00:26:56,369 --> 00:27:00,359
seen within the context that it was
actually taken. The chances are it will

294
00:27:00,359 --> 00:27:03,989
live on in many different contexts even
simultaneously and its meaning might

295
00:27:03,989 --> 00:27:07,800
well shift with each audience and each
time the subject will be vulnerable again!

296
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:10,700
Its why these class interviews are
set up the way they are, between a

297
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:15,320
photographer, a subject and the audience.
It's to explore that tension and then,

298
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:20,999
its for us to reflect on our relationships
with the world when we bring the camera

299
00:27:20,999 --> 00:27:24,900
to our eye and make the world our
subject. And listening to Dalia's

300
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:29,400
conversation one of the first things
that's apparent is that telling someone

301
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:34,380
else's story is a speculative endeavor.
I mean Dalia and Benjamin ask

302
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:38,820
permission of their subjects in the full
knowledge that they might well, and do

303
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:43,110
sometimes, say no. Dalia the talks of
people agreeing to have their

304
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:46,980
photographs made years after she's first
asked them and we begin to get a sense

305
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:50,520
of the negotiation that takes place
between the subject and the photographer

306
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:54,180
and the importance of the trust in that
relationship.

307
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:59,400
I said in the introduction that what Dalia's work will come to mean is interesting.

308
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:04,799
But that applies to all our images it is
difficult if not impossible for us to

309
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:09,000
know what our images will come to mean in future contexts, what their values might

310
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,200
be and to whom, which is problematic when we've negotiated or built a trust

311
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:18,510
relationship with our subjects. What did
we promise? What is their understanding?

312
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:23,640
What exactly did they give their consent
for? Have we been transparent and honest

313
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:28,679
about what we can and can't promise?
Because when the subject appears as an

314
00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:34,140
image they're going to stand alone and
we can't possibly predict what the many

315
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:40,020
possible feedback loops (consequences) for that subject might be.

316
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:43,880
We all have a right to carry a camera but does that automatically confer the right to

317
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:48,270
photograph other people? And if so then
it's interesting to consider what the

318
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:54,179
circumstances might be where we would
feel justified in doing so, if say it

319
00:28:54,179 --> 00:28:58,200
made the subject feel uncomfortable
distressed or scared, to go to the very

320
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:03,140
edge of where we feel uncomfortable
about dealing with that as photographers.

321
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:08,140
This is the thing that I love about Dalia's work, we don't know where it will lead

322
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:12,580
but we know it's built on foundation of her asking those tough questions

323
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:16,980
on a subject by subject basis,
exposing her own limitations and

324
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:21,120
vulnerabilities. And we know that each
image is a testament to that rigour and

325
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:25,860
integrity. It means that with each new
layer of the evolving project from

326
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:32,220
places, to artifacts, to portraits, oral
testimonies, to Facebook and to an

327
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:36,250
Instagram feed the project grows as more
and more people buy into the process that

328
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:37,520
Dahlia has set out.

329
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:44,480
So now is the time here in this session for you to put down

330
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:47,860
your own moral markers. To take a
metacognitive view,

331
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:54,640
to step back and look at your own practice from a distance, and to spell out your best, practice your code of ethics.

332
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:58,200
You can also now access the deep dive materials including the

333
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:02,100
extended interviews and our interview
with World Press Photo winner Rena Efendi

334
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,240
in that she reflects on all five of the

335
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:08,260
course's key questions with reference to
her work, and in particular two examples

336
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:10,740
where she's telling the stories of
things that are no longer there.

337
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:15,040
Once again, don't forget to dig around in the class notes. Investigate the hotspots.

338
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:19,880
See why particular parts of the conversation of being responded to and by whom.

339
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:24,140
Reach out and connect with people, and support those who can't get into a room full of fellow students

340
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:27,520
Once you've had your fill of that, revisit your four corners image

341
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:31,660
and don't forget to submit it in time for it to be included in our webinar review.

342
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,600
I'm Jonathan Worth and you can connect with me

343
