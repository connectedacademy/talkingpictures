00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,570
hello I'm Jonathan Werth from the

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:05,009
connected Academy talking pictures

3
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:06,390
critical engagement with visual

4
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:08,189
storytelling is brought to you in

5
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:10,950
association with the World Press Photo

6
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:12,240
Foundation today we're going to talk

7
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:13,679
about a project that documents the

8
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,360
families of people who are missing

9
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,190
people who have been forcibly

10
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,529
disappeared during a civil war that

11
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:21,840
lasted over extended period of time is

12
00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:23,460
why we asked you to think about how you

13
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,840
might go about telling the story of

14
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:28,109
something that isn't there in

15
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,580
preparation for this session you'll hear

16
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:31,470
from a photographer and journalist who

17
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:33,360
spent multiple years making an oral

18
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:35,460
history and visual document of people

19
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,620
who've lost family members to a war in

20
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:40,649
the Middle East that began over 40 years

21
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:43,050
ago and probably thousands of miles away

22
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:44,370
from where you are now you might well

23
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:46,530
question what the relevance of that is

24
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:49,289
to you but there are themes common to

25
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:51,180
all storytelling and so what we have

26
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:54,690
here is a particular case study where in

27
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:56,129
a lot of these themes crop up so as a

28
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:57,750
way to think about some of those themes

29
00:00:56,129 --> 00:00:59,309
and make them into jumping-off points

30
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:01,680
for us to discuss in a connected notes

31
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:03,120
let me ask you what are the different

32
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,850
vulnerabilities that you hear in this

33
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:09,900
conversation with whom do the duties of

34
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:12,030
care lie what are the responsibilities

35
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:15,119
of both the photographer and the

36
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:18,900
photographed and as audience what are

37
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:20,790
our responsibilities and finally do

38
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:22,229
images function as evidence it sounds

39
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:24,390
like an obvious one but ask yourselves

40
00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:26,130
again do images function as evidence and

41
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:28,860
how do images and their meaning change

42
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:30,570
over time so let me describe it again

43
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:33,689
differently with those questions as a

44
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:36,000
frame you're about to listen to a female

45
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:39,240
lebanese photographer who only ever knew

46
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,280
war growing up she became a photo editor

47
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:43,200
but bounced out to the effects of

48
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,130
looking at an unending stream of images

49
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,119
of war and its effects on her own people

50
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:50,130
you'll hear how she made peace with

51
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:52,170
photography again and then when the war

52
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:55,820
ended in a journalist left their work

53
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:58,500
done she began to make her body of work

54
00:01:55,820 --> 00:02:01,710
it's a series of portraits of the people

55
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:03,149
like herself who were left behind there

56
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:06,149
are three things I find particularly

57
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:08,879
fascinating about this conversation what

58
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:12,090
is it that she's making her approach to

59
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:13,530
making it and thirdly what will it come

60
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:16,420
to mean

61
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:18,370
each of her subjects is kind of an

62
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:20,260
archivist in a way carefully shepherding

63
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:22,209
the evidence of their loved ones those

64
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:24,730
scant everyday belongings of the people

65
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:27,909
who didn't come back a toothpaste tube a

66
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:29,650
pack of cigarettes poster each one a

67
00:02:27,909 --> 00:02:31,560
touchstone to the past and providing

68
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:34,989
another testament to their loved one and

69
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:38,349
the old age of these people reminds us

70
00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:40,060
that one can imagine a time not so far

71
00:02:38,349 --> 00:02:41,560
from now after the cigarettes have

72
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:44,019
disintegrated and the houses have been

73
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:45,760
cleared when all that will remain of

74
00:02:44,019 --> 00:02:48,939
these people's stories will be dahlias

75
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:52,150
project the missing and you've got

76
00:02:48,939 --> 00:02:53,950
Benjamin Chesterton a male English X

77
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:55,629
radio producer who doesn't speak Arabic

78
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:57,519
and who has to produce two different

79
00:02:55,629 --> 00:02:59,859
versions of her project for radio and

80
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,900
web audiences over a very short space of

81
00:02:59,859 --> 00:03:04,209
time with all is inherent technical

82
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:05,560
difficulties and you're going to hear

83
00:03:04,209 --> 00:03:07,239
from the people whose stories they're

84
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,790
both trying to tell and just what that

85
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:12,939
process was like and is like for them to

86
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:14,469
go through don't forget to share your

87
00:03:12,939 --> 00:03:16,239
notes in the platform comment on other

88
00:03:14,469 --> 00:03:19,780
people's notes take time to pause

89
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:21,129
reflect review sections go back through

90
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:23,049
the stuff you're not sure about dig

91
00:03:21,129 --> 00:03:24,970
around in those networked class notes

92
00:03:23,049 --> 00:03:27,940
that's where the real value is in the

93
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:29,409
conversation not the content and try be

94
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:32,400
supportive of the people who can't get

95
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:32,400
into a room with other learners

96
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:41,260
merhaba my name is Elias amici and I'm a

97
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:44,390
stalker for a base in Beirut Lebanon

98
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:47,090
since 2010 I've been working on the

99
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:51,560
estimated 17,000 missing and forcibly

100
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:58,070
disappeared from the 1975 to 1990 11e

101
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:59,450
Civil War the victims were from

102
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:01,580
different political and religious

103
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:05,030
backgrounds they came from all parts of

104
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:06,770
Lebanon and they were of all ages the

105
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:16,640
kidnappers did not just when she ate

106
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:18,170
between men or women at that time but

107
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:20,330
the missing was not exactly the first

108
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:25,760
project I did on the aftermath of wars

109
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:27,380
that I lived in the summer of 2006 I

110
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:29,720
witnessed the terrible Israeli

111
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:33,170
aggression on lebanon as i was working

112
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:36,880
for their social distress and its office

113
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:36,880
in ladies as a conservative

114
00:04:55,830 --> 00:05:01,920
a year later I went to the south of

115
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:05,550
Lebanon the area that suffered the most

116
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:10,290
during the 2064 and it was heavily

117
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:14,370
bombarded I had seen those images during

118
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:18,600
the 2006 war but I had not seen them to

119
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:20,100
my eyes since then that day I had my

120
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,380
camera with me

121
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:26,220
I entered homes that were destroyed and

122
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:29,430
abandoned what really shocked me was how

123
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:32,130
much the private homes of people had to

124
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:34,350
come public anyone could enter that

125
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:38,850
because there were no more doors anymore

126
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:41,700
and obviously no more inhabitants on the

127
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:44,700
floors lay clothes of those who lived

128
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:47,880
there sometimes photograph belongings

129
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:50,460
keys even though there were no people to

130
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:54,110
photograph I said that those houses told

131
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:57,300
the stories of their owners those spaces

132
00:05:54,110 --> 00:06:00,800
reminded me of how much my life turned

133
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:00,800
into public during the war

134
00:06:02,569 --> 00:06:09,529
I have no personal life back down my

135
00:06:05,869 --> 00:06:12,199
private one would like that as a photo

136
00:06:09,529 --> 00:06:16,159
editor my phone was ranking constantly

137
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:19,909
starting as early as 5 or 60 and

138
00:06:16,159 --> 00:06:22,159
sometimes at 10 hours after midnight my

139
00:06:19,909 --> 00:06:24,379
computer screen was full of messages

140
00:06:22,159 --> 00:06:27,919
from everybody requesting photographs

141
00:06:24,379 --> 00:06:28,399
from all ApS offices like all over the

142
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:31,249
world

143
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:34,959
I had to stare at photographs on the

144
00:06:31,249 --> 00:06:37,669
computer screen and readings for 34 days

145
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:40,520
images of the injured the dead the

146
00:06:37,669 --> 00:06:42,159
destruction people crying the death of

147
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:44,419
their loved ones

148
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:47,930
heartbreaking photographs of people I

149
00:06:44,419 --> 00:06:50,779
related to the war had forcibly turned

150
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:54,759
my life from private to a public one the

151
00:06:50,779 --> 00:06:54,759
same as for those faces

152
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:14,080
so I took photographs of few houses and

153
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:21,160
I then formed a series of photographs

154
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:24,370
that I tried to abandon spaces I only

155
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:26,140
shot that over few days but I felt it

156
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:30,430
was my way of reconciling with

157
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:32,170
photography after that project I started

158
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:34,230
working on the Lebanese issues

159
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:36,970
especially those related to women right

160
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:40,080
until I decided to start researching the

161
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:40,080
subject of the missing

162
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:49,150
sorry McGee see professor of English and

163
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:53,290
comparative literature at the University

164
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:56,080
of California Los Angeles the Lebanese

165
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:59,350
civil war began in 1975 and ended in

166
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:01,110
1990 it was a war over the distribution

167
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:03,250
of power among and between different

168
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:05,560
sectarian groups in the country or

169
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:07,420
really more specifically the

170
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:10,960
distribution of power among the elites

171
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:13,150
of different sectarian groups the

172
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:15,070
principal axis of tension in the war was

173
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:17,230
between those who wanted to maintain the

174
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:19,840
older system of Maronite hegemony the

175
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:21,610
privileged Maronite Catholic elites and

176
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,760
those who wanted to make the political

177
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:25,900
system more representative of and

178
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:27,970
accountable to the population of the

179
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:30,340
entire country so although it's often

180
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:32,710
depicted as a religious war or war over

181
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:35,530
religion or even a war between religious

182
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:38,430
communities or sects it really was a

183
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:41,200
struggle over the distribution of power

184
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:43,420
despite this fighting and displacements

185
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,370
of population did often blend into

186
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:47,470
tensions between different sectarian

187
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:51,010
communities and at times degenerated

188
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:53,320
into blind inter-communal violence on

189
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:56,140
top of the killed and injured there were

190
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:58,990
thousands of kidnappings it took place

191
00:08:56,140 --> 00:09:01,710
during the war the kidnappings were

192
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:05,080
often done on the basis of one's

193
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:07,330
communal or religious identity because

194
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:09,970
Lebanese identity documents officially

195
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:12,790
list your religion if you're caught by

196
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:14,110
the wrong kind of party and you have the

197
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:15,550
wrong kind of idea you could be in

198
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:18,550
trouble and that happened to a lot of

199
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:21,010
people during the war the kidnappings

200
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:23,560
were sometimes for ransom

201
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:25,900
sometimes for murder sometimes for

202
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:27,970
execution and torture sometimes for

203
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:30,490
reprisal sometimes revenge and sometimes

204
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:32,460
for personal vendettas so it's not clear

205
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:35,140
necessarily why somebody's kidnapped

206
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:36,220
very often people would disappear and

207
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:38,920
that would be that nobody would know

208
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:41,050
what happens to them everybody knows

209
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:43,060
somebody who was kidnapped I personally

210
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:44,860
know a neighbor of ours who was

211
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:47,050
kidnapped and then held for a few days

212
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:49,750
and then released I have a relative who

213
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:50,580
was kidnapped and released I think the

214
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:53,100
same day

215
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:55,410
and one of my closest childhood friends

216
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:58,860
was kidnapped with his parents and never

217
00:09:55,410 --> 00:10:00,810
heard from again and of course there's a

218
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:02,519
big difference between killed and

219
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:05,220
wounded and those who had disappeared

220
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:07,050
because killed or wounded I mean awful

221
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:08,399
is that is of course for the people

222
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:10,410
themselves and for their families and

223
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,120
friends and so forth at least you know

224
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:15,360
what happened whereas people who dis

225
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:17,040
disappear you don't know what happens to

226
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:21,300
them so there's no closure there's no

227
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:23,070
resolution to the trauma it's important

228
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:25,500
to point out that those responsible for

229
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:28,260
the kidnappings for the most part remain

230
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:30,329
very close to power in Lebanon given the

231
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:32,910
country's amnesty law right after the

232
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:34,980
war they've been absolved of guilt and

233
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:37,110
responsibility fates of those that

234
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:39,720
disappeared in the war has never been

235
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:41,070
resolved and certainly nobody's been

236
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:44,420
held accountable for the crimes they

237
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:48,300
committed during the war so basically

238
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:50,190
during the war of 2006 many

239
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:52,800
international photographers and

240
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:55,920
journalists came to Lebanon to cover the

241
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:59,490
events the country was full of foreign

242
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:01,350
press the war lasted for 34 days and the

243
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:04,529
pressure is doing a superb work like a

244
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:08,339
super work covering the direct events

245
00:11:04,529 --> 00:11:11,339
the bombardment tires something I could

246
00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:14,399
have never done when the ceasefire was

247
00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:16,500
agreed on in August 14 the media kept

248
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:18,570
documenting the direct aftermath for a

249
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:21,600
few weeks before the country was empty

250
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:24,120
again and the people who were left

251
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,790
behind were left to suffer with their

252
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:28,709
own new realities that was my case to

253
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:30,690
all the international photographers had

254
00:11:28,709 --> 00:11:34,709
left they all had them months off to

255
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:36,810
rest but I was the one who had to stay

256
00:11:34,709 --> 00:11:40,949
behind and the country that was this

257
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:45,000
word was the one I lived in it was like

258
00:11:40,949 --> 00:11:48,420
the horror never ended this is the same

259
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,820
case for the Civil War and all the wars

260
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:54,690
conflict trashes that happened since I

261
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:58,620
was born the media leaves in those ends

262
00:11:54,690 --> 00:12:01,230
so through my photographs I try to tell

263
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:04,019
the stories of people who are left

264
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:07,730
behind those who stories do not

265
00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:10,439
perfectly interest the mainstream media

266
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:14,040
the issue of the missing and kidnapped

267
00:12:10,439 --> 00:12:16,470
haven't been covered much shaky so in my

268
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:17,100
project I wanted to dig deeper in the

269
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:27,959
story

270
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:30,420
I met Ida and Leda Jada at the chance

271
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:33,809
during a gathering for Odette's Allen

272
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:36,059
who was killed when a car hit her but

273
00:12:33,809 --> 00:12:39,899
that was the mother of two young men and

274
00:12:36,059 --> 00:12:44,579
his sister her son and her daughter were

275
00:12:39,899 --> 00:12:47,519
kidnapped in the 80s the families were

276
00:12:44,579 --> 00:12:49,769
all devastated it was yet another mother

277
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:53,250
who had died before receiving any

278
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:56,929
information on the fate of her children

the Day of Ashura has just allowed us to

281
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:09,899
visited at home for few minutes as I

282
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:11,759
went from one room to another her home

283
00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:15,350
looked as if it was untouched for

284
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:18,809
decades inside her daughter's closet

285
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:22,230
hang a life-size poster of a male model

286
00:13:18,809 --> 00:13:27,720
on the bottom of the closet next to shoe

287
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:30,329
boxes lay some old dolls and on the wall

288
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:35,399
was hanging a black-and-white poster of

289
00:13:30,329 --> 00:13:38,999
the Eagles those are items that people

290
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:42,360
throw away daily while they have no

291
00:13:38,999 --> 00:13:44,549
value for us they act as one of the main

292
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:48,959
evidence for the one signed presence of

293
00:13:44,549 --> 00:13:51,629
the missing person the photographs of

294
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:54,379
the belonging gave much more depth to

295
00:13:51,629 --> 00:13:54,379
the project

296
00:13:57,180 --> 00:14:03,130
three years later in 2012

297
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:04,660
I called Gina - after as she and her

298
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:07,440

299
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:09,940

stories of people who are left behind

326

those who stories did not specifically

interest the mainstream media the issue

328
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:42,730
of the missing and kidnap haven't been

329
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:45,550
covered much shaky so in my project I

330
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:47,440
wanted to dig deeper in the story - to

331
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:49,630
learn more about the different

332
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,730
narratives behind the missing and the

333
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:53,800
kidnapped at the beginning I

334
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:55,630
photographed for trade for example of

335
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:58,030
the families then I learned about the

336
00:15:55,630 --> 00:16:00,400
belongings they kept of the victims with

337
00:15:58,030 --> 00:16:03,160
each family a different story the same

338
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:04,600
pain of course but a different story and

339
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:06,550
details

340
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:10,120
after a month or two I got in touch with

341
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:12,520
Benjamin Chesterton from dark rabbit we

342
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:16,020
email back and forth and he was

343
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:18,250
interested in my way of photography I

344
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:20,350
told him about the project of the

345
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:22,270
missing and she was later decided to

346
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:27,390
come to Beirut and work with me on that

347
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:30,700
project for the BBC for three days

348
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:32,640
Benjamin and I met mothers of victims of

349
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:38,350
enforced disappearances

350
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:41,200
we met with NGO people MP X militia

351
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:43,360
members women telling about the last

352
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:46,360
time they saw their children their

353
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:48,520
husbands they talked about their

354
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:52,140
continuous struggle and their only wish

355
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:52,140
to know the fate of their loved ones

356
00:16:54,120 --> 00:17:00,570
mostly indicated with the families were

357
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:03,100
conducted in their mother tongue and

358
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:05,280
obviously Dalia would conduct those

359
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:10,510
interviews and I would assess with

360
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:12,610
really helping her to shape them in in a

361
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:14,380
sense in that situations its hardest for

362
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:16,420
her because she's got to bring a

363
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:19,240
stranger into a situation is very

364
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:21,610
painful for those women and if you read

365
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:24,459
the interviews that she conducted with

366
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:27,850
them for this project they talked about

367
00:17:24,459 --> 00:17:31,240
each time how the wind is opened up and

368
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:34,120
that is an extremely difficult thing for

369
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:37,200
anybody to do repeatedly in front of

370
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:37,200
journalists or anyone

1985 along with his nephew come on as

374
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:05,550
they were coming back from their work

375
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:07,470
they never heard of them again so along

376
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:10,740
with a man the mother of my friend

377
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:12,570
I visited them at home either refused to

378
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:16,950
be photographed even after a man

379
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:24,060
interested I looked for the best place

380
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:26,520
to take the photograph of Lena there

381
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:29,040
were two chairs that were placed on each

382
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:33,270
side of a small table and on the wall

383
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:35,610
behind them a painting was hanging high

384
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:38,130
that brought a framed portrait of her

385
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:41,670
husband from the 80s and placed it on

386
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:45,540
the table along with his fight another

387
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:48,510

390
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:57,740
illusion we can imbibe as no command ok

391
00:18:54,450 --> 00:19:03,590
me have deduction the conception written

392
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:03,590
by a stubborn stubborn

393
00:19:04,739 --> 00:19:12,249
as I move the sofa facing the two teeth

394
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:16,359
and stood behind it to have more space

395
00:19:12,249 --> 00:19:18,670
in distance either suddenly sat on the

396
00:19:16,359 --> 00:19:25,350
seat and told me to take the photograph

397
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:28,749
[Music]

398
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:29,470
we were all shocked a man Lina and

399
00:19:28,749 --> 00:19:32,049
myself

400
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:34,659
she had resisted being photographed for

401
00:19:32,049 --> 00:19:38,470
over an hour while we were having tea

402
00:19:34,659 --> 00:19:40,570
earlier so I just clicked through frames

403
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:43,239
and then her daughter said for the

404
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:44,739
portrait after her instance what I love

405
00:19:43,239 --> 00:19:48,429
about it there's a huge amount of

406
00:19:44,739 --> 00:19:52,470
respect that is not trying she's not

407
00:19:48,429 --> 00:19:54,190
trying too hard and it's it's subtle and

408
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:56,590
it's poetic

409
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:58,600
so he talked about the idea beautifully

410
00:19:56,590 --> 00:20:01,649
she does and it's a beautiful images of

411
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,649
all the limits

412
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:18,090
so anyway when I developed the films and

413
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:21,840
scan them I can't hide a photograph to

414
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:26,240
the jedis by email both of them thought

415
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:29,940
that the photograph looked very empty a

416
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:32,370
man and her daughter on the other side

417
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:35,880
thought it was beautiful and represented

418
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:40,530
her situation and the emptiness in her

419
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:42,660
life I explained by email also that this

420
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:44,370
was exactly what I was aiming at the

421
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:47,640
empty chair that was supposed to be

422
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:51,000
occupied by the husband had she not been

423
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:53,910
kidnapped instead a photograph of him

424
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:57,210

425
00:20:53,910 --> 00:21:04,590

426
00:20:57,210 --> 00:21:08,510
kidnapped in the photograph he's smiling

427
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:12,480
when life was better for the family and

428
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:16,230
by coincidence he was looking at his

429
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:19,770
wife Ida who has aged and was looking at

430
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:25,170

quicker there's nothing to be petted

454
00:22:56,100 --> 00:23:02,340
there that is a strength and a defiance

455
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:06,790
and an anger mixed with a little bit of

456
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:09,200
hope that each day is getting spot down

457
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:11,580
[Music]

458
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:15,360
so it's always like a privilege and a

459
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:17,970
pleasure to be in such a place as a

460
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:20,970
welcome guest very much as a welcome

461
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:25,980
guest but professionally you're thinking

462
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:29,820
what do I need and really that's welcome

463
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:33,060
and that trust it's only worth it for

464
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:35,640
them if you do a good job if you tell

465
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:37,770
their story properly it's only worth the

466
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:40,440
pain that they have to go through when

467
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:42,540
they open themselves up if you meet that

468
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:45,900
with a professionalism and a

469
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:48,120
determination to get it right victors

470
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:50,430
were had a deist of the stream of two

471
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:52,890
hands and wash up rather than Julius and

472
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:55,320
I see for example give us a meticulous

473
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:58,650
team at a salon is a ridiculous

474
00:23:55,320 --> 00:24:00,330
amendment amongst socialism another kind

475
00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:05,700
of is what happens what goes up a fluid

476
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:10,310

Thomas ball your doll conceal a solar

478
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:20,100
nebula perfect I believe that taking the

479
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:22,320
time to get to know people going back

480
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:24,120
again and again and again and showing

481
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:26,880
that you care about them and their

482
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:29,490
problem and that we're not only here to

483
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:32,490
photograph them and leave but that we

484
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:36,870
are really trying to make a change and

485
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:38,940
then their cause has become ours this

486
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:41,700
makes people open up and trust us and

487
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:43,530
let us into their life the families tell

488
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:46,950
the stories of the missing loved ones

489
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:50,130
they show their belongings that they had

490
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:51,720
guarded for decades they share all the

491
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:55,170
skills and evidence they had collected

492
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:57,420
throughout the years I had understood

493
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:59,790
the value of those belongings and

494
00:24:57,420 --> 00:25:03,900
photographed them as precious relics

495
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:06,180
each item alone I was thinking about

496
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:08,400
what I wanted to say particularly in

497
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:09,029
relation to you as the audience looking

498
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:13,139
at though

499
00:25:09,029 --> 00:25:15,239
and how you might respond to that

500
00:25:13,139 --> 00:25:18,239
phrasing and the thing that I wanted to

501
00:25:15,239 --> 00:25:20,669
tell you was that the danger of the

502
00:25:18,239 --> 00:25:24,239
photo is that it holds someone in time

503
00:25:20,669 --> 00:25:27,269
in moment it kind of says this is this

504
00:25:24,239 --> 00:25:28,859
is it right and life is not like that

505
00:25:27,269 --> 00:25:31,859
because it's much more complex and

506
00:25:28,859 --> 00:25:34,439
sometimes we need earlier to have sat

507
00:25:31,859 --> 00:25:36,629
down with the women and just hear what

508
00:25:34,439 --> 00:25:38,099
they think and it kind of takes away a

509
00:25:36,629 --> 00:25:40,829
lot of the formality of what you're

510
00:25:38,099 --> 00:25:43,529
seeing and your feelings about what

511
00:25:40,829 --> 00:25:46,259
you're seeing in fact what I would say

512
00:25:43,529 --> 00:25:48,779
is her interview with the women in many

513
00:25:46,259 --> 00:25:51,239
ways is actually more humanizing than

514
00:25:48,779 --> 00:25:54,419
the photograph itself and that's

515
00:25:51,239 --> 00:26:00,749
something really interesting to reflect

516
00:25:54,419 --> 00:26:03,059
on thank you everyone

517
00:26:00,749 --> 00:26:06,059
there are lesson to it not only within

518
00:26:03,059 --> 00:26:07,949
the stories contained the missing but

519
00:26:06,059 --> 00:26:10,319
there are lessons for us on how visual

520
00:26:07,949 --> 00:26:12,539
storytelling is done what those dynamics

521
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:14,699
are in that process and pointers to how

522
00:26:12,539 --> 00:26:17,179
we can become more sophisticated as both

523
00:26:14,699 --> 00:26:19,859
media producers and media consumers

524
00:26:17,179 --> 00:26:21,899
there is a tension in photography and

525
00:26:19,859 --> 00:26:24,509
there always has been an uneven

526
00:26:21,899 --> 00:26:26,999
distribution of power unnecessary

527
00:26:24,509 --> 00:26:28,709
vulnerability the basic premise is the

528
00:26:26,999 --> 00:26:30,119
same Photography enables us to see the

529
00:26:28,709 --> 00:26:32,339
world through the eyes and the lens of

530
00:26:30,119 --> 00:26:35,369
someone else and there's an intimacy in

531
00:26:32,339 --> 00:26:37,349
that but when a person brings a camera

532
00:26:35,369 --> 00:26:39,359
or a smartphone up to their eye they

533
00:26:37,349 --> 00:26:41,639
there is immediately the photographer

534
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:43,799
and the photographed and there will be

535
00:26:41,639 --> 00:26:45,749
the audience or the viewer at some point

536
00:26:43,799 --> 00:26:47,909
and the most powerful stakeholder in

537
00:26:45,749 --> 00:26:51,329
those three-way relationships is almost

538
00:26:47,909 --> 00:26:52,979
never the subject the subject has to

539
00:26:51,329 --> 00:26:54,479
agree to be vulnerable and not just once

540
00:26:52,979 --> 00:26:56,369
not just at the point of the shutter

541
00:26:54,479 --> 00:26:57,719
release that photograph may never be

542
00:26:56,369 --> 00:27:00,359
seen within the context that it was

543
00:26:57,719 --> 00:27:02,119
actually taken the chances are it will

544
00:27:00,359 --> 00:27:03,989
live on in many different contexts even

545
00:27:02,119 --> 00:27:05,729
simultaneously and its meaning might

546
00:27:03,989 --> 00:27:06,809
well shift with each audience and each

547
00:27:05,729 --> 00:27:09,509
time the subject will be vulnerable

548
00:27:06,809 --> 00:27:10,709
again is why these class interviews are

549
00:27:09,509 --> 00:27:12,659
set up the way they are between a

550
00:27:10,709 --> 00:27:15,809
photographer a subject and the audience

551
00:27:12,659 --> 00:27:19,139
it's to explore that tension and then is

552
00:27:15,809 --> 00:27:20,999
for us to reflect on our relationships

553
00:27:19,139 --> 00:27:22,860
with the world when we bring the camera

554
00:27:20,999 --> 00:27:24,900
to our eye and make the world our

555
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:26,730
object and listening to dahlias

556
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:29,400
conversation one of the first things

557
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:32,010
that's apparent is that telling someone

558
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:34,380
else's story is a speculative endeavor

559
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:36,510
I mean Darla and Benjamin asked

560
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:38,820
permission of their subjects in the full

561
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:42,179
knowledge that they might well and do

562
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:43,110
sometimes say no darling the talks of

563
00:27:42,179 --> 00:27:45,360
people agreeing to have their

564
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:46,980
photographs made years after she's first

565
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,929
asked them and we begin to get a sense

566
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:50,520
of the negotiation that takes place

567
00:27:48,929 --> 00:27:52,530
between the subject and the photographer

568
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:55,740
and the importance of the trust in that

569
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:57,480
relationship I've said in the

570
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:59,940
introduction that what dahlias work will

571
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:02,850
come to mean is interesting but that

572
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:04,799
applies to all our images it is

573
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:06,570
difficult if not impossible for us to

574
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:09,000
know what our images will come to me in

575
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:11,429
future contexts what their values might

576
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,200
be and to whom which is problematic when

577
00:28:11,429 --> 00:28:15,780
we've negotiated or built a trust

578
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:18,510
relationship with our subjects what did

579
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:20,370
we promise what is their understanding

580
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:23,640
what exactly did they give their consent

581
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:26,910
for have we been transparent and honest

582
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:28,679
about what we can and can't promise

583
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:31,130
because when the subject appears as an

584
00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:34,140
image they're going to stand alone and

585
00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:37,650
we can't possibly predict what the many

586
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:40,710
possible feedback loops consequences for

587
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:42,120
that subject might be we all have a

588
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:43,890
right to carry a camera but does that

589
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:46,500
automatically confer the right to

590
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:48,270
photograph other people and if so then

591
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:50,790
it's interesting to consider what the

592
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:54,179
circumstances might be where we would

593
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:55,860
feel justified in doing so if say it

594
00:28:54,179 --> 00:28:58,200
made the subject feel uncomfortable

595
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:59,910
distressed or scared to go to the very

596
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:03,169
edge of where we feel uncomfortable

597
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:05,130
about dealing with that as photographers

598
00:29:03,169 --> 00:29:07,620
this is the thing that I love about

599
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:09,840
dahlias work we don't know where it will

600
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:11,880
lead but we know it's built on a

601
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:14,880
foundation of her asking those tough

602
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:16,980
questions on a subject by subject basis

603
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,900
exposing her own limitations and

604
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:21,120
vulnerabilities and we know that each

605
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:24,090
image is a testament to that rigour and

606
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:25,860
integrity it means that with each new

607
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:29,160
layer of the evolving project from

608
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:32,220
places to artifacts to portraits all all

609
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:34,169
testimonies to face book and to an

610
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:36,250
Instagram feed the project grows as more

611
00:29:34,169 --> 00:29:41,530
and more people buy into the process the

612
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:44,170
Dahlia has set out so now is the time

613
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:46,570
here in this session for you to put down

614
00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:49,150
your own moral markers to take a

615
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:50,680
metacognitive view to step back and look

616
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:52,990
at your own practice from a distance and

617
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:56,560
to spell out your best practice your

618
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:58,210
code of ethics you can also now access

619
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:59,980
the deep dive materials including the

620
00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:01,570
extended interviews and our interview

621
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:02,170
with World Press Photo winner Rena

622
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:04,240
Efendi

623
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:05,980
in that she reflects on all five of the

624
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:08,260
courses key questions with reference to

625
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:09,430
her work and in particular two examples

626
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:11,170
where she's telling the stories of

627
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:12,730
things that are no longer there once

628
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:15,370
again don't forget to dig around in the

629
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:16,630
class notes investigate the hotspots see

630
00:30:15,370 --> 00:30:20,140
why particular parts of the conversation

631
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:21,790
of being responded to and by whom reach

632
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:23,110
out and connect with people and support

633
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:25,450
those who can't get into a room full of

634
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:27,520
fellow students once you've had your

635
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:29,260
fill of that revisit your four corners

636
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:30,520
image and don't forget to submit it in

637
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:31,630
time for it to be included in our

638
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:33,820
webinar review
