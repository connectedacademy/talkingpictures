00:00:00,459 --> 00:00:04,759
hello i'm jonathan from the connected

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:06,529
academy talking pictures critical

3
00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:08,180
engagement with visual storytelling is

4
00:00:06,529 --> 00:00:12,110
brought to you in association with the

5
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:13,340
World Press Photo foundation this week's

6
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:15,170
conversation is between the Lebanese

7
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:17,720
photographer Dalia committee and

8
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:19,279
subjects for her project the missing the

9
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:22,010
audience perspective is provided by a

10
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:23,990
filmmaker Benjamin Chesterton additional

11
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:25,760
historical context is provided by Sri

12
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:27,710
Makdessi professor of English and

13
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,140
comparative literature at the University

14
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:31,550
of California Los Angeles so on one

15
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:33,229
level we have a photographer and

16
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:34,850
journalist who spent multiple years

17
00:00:33,229 --> 00:00:37,010
making an oral history and visual

18
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:38,989
document of people who've lost family

19
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:41,299
members to a war that started 40 years

20
00:00:38,989 --> 00:00:44,749
ago and probably a million miles away

21
00:00:41,299 --> 00:00:46,459
from you are now so I can imagine that

22
00:00:44,749 --> 00:00:48,319
maybe you're thinking what does that got

23
00:00:46,459 --> 00:00:51,619
to do with me well to be honest I don't

24
00:00:48,319 --> 00:00:52,850
I don't really know but maybe if we

25
00:00:51,619 --> 00:00:54,799
think about it slightly differently

26
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:56,600
there are some jumping-off points for

27
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:58,399
you to go and discuss in the connected

28
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,529
notes which is kind of the point the

29
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,179
content we provide today is a starting

30
00:01:00,529 --> 00:01:02,829
point for this conversation it's not the

31
00:01:02,179 --> 00:01:05,299
end

32
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:10,280
thinking in particular about themes like

33
00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:13,189
time evidence vulnerability trust and

34
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:14,920
responsibility there are three areas I

35
00:01:13,189 --> 00:01:18,820
find fascinating about this interview

36
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:23,259
one what exactly is it that she's making

37
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:26,630
to her approach to making it and three

38
00:01:23,259 --> 00:01:27,530
what will it eventually come to me now I

39
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:29,719
don't have answers for those questions

40
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:33,740
I've got a few observations and I've got

41
00:01:29,719 --> 00:01:34,939
a few ideas but I don't have answers so

42
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:37,520
if I describe it slightly differently

43
00:01:34,939 --> 00:01:39,530
then you're about to listen to a female

44
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,530
lebanese photographer who only ever knew

45
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:44,329
war growing up she became a photo editor

46
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:46,399
but burnt out through the effects of

47
00:01:44,329 --> 00:01:48,609
looking at an unending stream of images

48
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,630
of war and its effects on her own people

49
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:52,340
you'll hear how she made peace with

50
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:54,350
photography again and then when the war

51
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:57,939
ended in a journalist left their work

52
00:01:54,350 --> 00:02:00,319
done she began to make her body of work

53
00:01:57,939 --> 00:02:02,990
it's a series of portraits of people

54
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:04,939
like yourself who are left behind each

55
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:07,159
one in a way I'm thinking of as an

56
00:02:04,939 --> 00:02:09,049
archivist archivists of the scant

57
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:11,569
belongings of the people who didn't come

58
00:02:09,049 --> 00:02:13,370
back each one provides another testament

59
00:02:11,569 --> 00:02:14,190
for their loved one and the ages of

60
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:16,800
these people were

61
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:18,990
- that well one can imagine a time not

62
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,720
far from now when all that will remain

63
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:24,990
of their stories will be dahlias project

64
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:26,760
the missing and you have a male English

65
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:28,500
X radio producer who doesn't speak

66
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,330
Arabic and who has to produce two

67
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:32,520
different versions of her project for

68
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:34,350
radio and web audiences over a very

69
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:37,020
short space of time with all its

70
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:38,160
inherent difficulties and of course

71
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:39,660
you're going to hear from the people

72
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,610
whose stories they're both trying to

73
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:46,740
tell and exactly what that feels like

74
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:48,630
both then and now don't forget make your

75
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:50,790
notes in the platform that's where the

76
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:52,200
value is and don't complain if people

77
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:53,430
then comment back on your notes if you

78
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,200
don't comment on their they're like

79
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:58,070
Valentine's cards if you don't send them

80
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,070
don't expect to get them

81
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:04,150
whatever

82
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:07,110
my name is Dalia sanuki and I'm a

83
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:10,330
stalker Farah based in Beirut Lebanon

84
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:12,970
since 2010 I have been working on the

85
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:17,380
estimated 17,000 missing and forcibly

86
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:24,010
disappeared from the 1975 to 1990 eleven

87
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:25,390
in civil war the victims were from

88
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:27,550
different political and religious

89
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:30,940
backgrounds they came from all parts of

90
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:32,500
Lebanon and they were of all ages the

91
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:42,550
kidnappers did not just friendship

92
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:44,140
between men or women at that time but

93
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:46,270
the missing was not exactly the first

94
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:51,730
project I did on the aftermath of wars

95
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:53,440
that I lived in the summer of 2006 I

96
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:55,630
witnessed the terrible is really

97
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:59,110
aggression on lebanon as I was working

98
00:03:55,630 --> 00:04:02,820
for The Associated Press in its office

99
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:02,820
invaded as a photo editor

100
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:27,700
a year later I went to the south of

101
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:31,390
Lebanon the area that suffered the most

102
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:36,220
during the 2064 and it was heavily

103
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:39,910
bombarded I had seen those images during

104
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:44,200
the 2006 war but I had not seen them

105
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:46,690
through my eyes since then that day I

106
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:49,260
had my camera with me and I entered

107
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:52,720
homes that were destroyed and abandoned

108
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:55,540
what really shocked me was how much the

109
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:58,690
private homes of people had become

110
00:04:55,540 --> 00:05:01,140
public anyone could enter them because

111
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:04,780
there were no more doors anymore and

112
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:07,630
obviously no more inhabitants on the

113
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:08,230
floors lay clothes of those who lived

114
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:11,430
there

115
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:13,780
sometimes photograph belongings keys

116
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:16,390
even though there were no people to

117
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:20,040
photograph I said that those houses told

118
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:23,230
the stories of their owners those spaces

119
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:26,700
reminded me of how much my life turned

120
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:26,700
into public during the war

121
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:35,460
I have no personal life back down my

122
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:38,100
private one would like that as a photo

123
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:41,910
editor my phone was ranking constantly

124
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:45,840
starting as early as 5 or 6 a.m.

125
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:47,700
sometimes 10 hours after midnight my

126
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,310
computer screen was full of messages

127
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:53,700
from everybody requesting photographs

128
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:54,390
from all a peep offices like all over

129
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:57,180
the world

130
00:05:54,390 --> 00:06:00,860
I had to stare at photographs on the

131
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:03,570
computer screen every day for 34 days

132
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:06,450
images of the injured the dead the

133
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:08,090
destruction people crying the death of

134
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:10,380
their loved ones

135
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:13,860
heartbreaking photographs of people I

136
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:16,680
related to the war had forcibly turned

137
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:20,480
my life from private to a public one the

138
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:20,480
same as for those spaces

139
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:40,010
so I took photographs of few houses and

140
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:47,060
I then formed a series of photographs

141
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:50,300
that I tried to abandon spaces I only

142
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:52,040
shot that over a few days but I felt it

143
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:56,360
was my way of reconciling with

144
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:58,100
photography after that project I started

145
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:00,230
working on the Lebanese issues

146
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:02,900
especially those related to women right

147
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:11,840
until I decided to start researching the

148
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:13,430
subject of the missing sari Makdessi

149
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,140
professor of English and comparative

150
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:19,190
literature at the University of

151
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:21,980
California Los Angeles the Lebanese

152
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:25,520
civil war began in 1975 and ended in

153
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:27,350
1990 it was a war over the distribution

154
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,180
of power among it between different

155
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:31,460
sectarian groups in the country or

156
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:33,320
really more specifically the

157
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:36,890
distribution of power among the elites

158
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:39,020
of different sectarian groups the

159
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:40,970
principal axis of tension in the war was

160
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:43,130
between those who wanted to maintain the

161
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:45,770
older system of Maronite hegemony the

162
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:47,540
privileged Maronite Catholic elites and

163
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:49,690
those who wanted to make the political

164
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:51,830
system more representative of and

165
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:52,580
accountable to the population of the

166
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:54,620
entire country

167
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:57,050
so although it's often depicted as a

168
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:59,210
religious war or war over religion or

169
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:02,090
even a war between religious communities

170
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:04,360
or sects it really was a struggle over

171
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:07,070
the distribution of power

172
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:09,350
despite this fighting and displacement

173
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:11,300
of population did often blend into

174
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:13,370
tensions between different sectarian

175
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:16,670
communities and at times degenerated

176
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:19,250
into blind inter-communal violence on

177
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:22,100
top of killed and injured there were

178
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:24,890
thousands of kidnappings that took place

179
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:27,610
during the war the kidnappings were

180
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:31,010
often done on the basis of one's

181
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:33,229
communal or religious identity because

182
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:35,870
my beneath identity documents officially

183
00:08:33,229 --> 00:08:38,690
list your religion if you're caught by

184
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:39,390
the wrong kind of party and you have the

185
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:40,830
wrong kind of

186
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:42,860
you could be in trouble and that

187
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:46,020
happened a lot of people during the war

188
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:46,950
the kidnappings were sometimes for

189
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:49,470
ransom

190
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:51,840
sometimes for murder sometimes for

191
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:53,880
execution and torture sometimes for

192
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:56,430
reprisal sometimes revenge and sometimes

193
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:58,400
her personal vendettas so it's not clear

194
00:08:56,430 --> 00:09:01,110
necessarily why somebody's kidnapped

195
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:02,130
very often people would disappear and

196
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:04,860
that would be that nobody would know

197
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:06,960
what happens to them everybody knows

198
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:08,970
somebody who was kidnapped I personally

199
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:10,770
know a neighbor of ours who was

200
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:12,990
kidnapped and then held for a few days

201
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:15,690
and then released I have a relative who

202
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:18,450
was kidnapped and released I think the

203
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:20,400
same day and one of my closest childhood

204
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:24,600
friends was kidnapped with his parents

205
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:26,550
and never heard from again and of course

206
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,170
there's a big difference between killed

207
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:30,600
and wounded and those who had

208
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:32,700
disappeared because killed or wounded I

209
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,200
mean awful as that is of course for the

210
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:36,180
people themselves and for their families

211
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,830
and friends and so forth at least you

212
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:40,800
know what happened whereas people who

213
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:42,450
dis disappear you don't know what

214
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:45,860
happens to them so there's no closure

215
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:48,240
there's no resolution for the trauma

216
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:49,950
it's important to point out that those

217
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:53,220
responsible for the kidnappings of the

218
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:55,380
most part remain very close to power in

219
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:57,810
Lebanon given the country's amnesty law

220
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:59,910
right after the war they've been

221
00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:01,620
absolved of guilt and responsibility and

222
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:02,460
has never been a kind of inquest or a

223
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:05,640
sort of Truth and Reconciliation

224
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:06,990
committee and certainly nobody's been

225
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:09,260
held accountable for the crimes they

226
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:12,330
committed during the war so basically

227
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:16,370
the fates of those that disappeared in

228
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:16,370
the war has never been resolved

229
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:26,860
during the war of 2006 many

230
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:29,470
international photographers and

231
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:32,589
journalists came to Lebanon to cover the

232
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:36,160
event the country was full of foreign

233
00:10:32,589 --> 00:10:38,019
press the war lasted for 34 days and the

234
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:41,199
press was doing a superb work like a

235
00:10:38,019 --> 00:10:45,009
super work covering the direct events

236
00:10:41,199 --> 00:10:48,009
the bombardment tires something I could

237
00:10:45,009 --> 00:10:51,040
have never done when the ceasefire was

238
00:10:48,009 --> 00:10:53,439
agreed on in August 14 the new Jack kept

239
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:55,540
documenting the direct aftermath for few

240
00:10:53,439 --> 00:10:59,259
weeks before the country was empty again

241
00:10:55,540 --> 00:11:01,360
and the people who were left behind were

242
00:10:59,259 --> 00:11:03,999
left to suffer with their own new

243
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,620
realities that was my case to all the

244
00:11:03,999 --> 00:11:08,439
international photographers had left

245
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:12,069
they all had them month off to rest but

246
00:11:08,439 --> 00:11:14,230
I was the one who had to stay behind and

247
00:11:12,069 --> 00:11:18,069
the country that was this word was the

248
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:22,529
one I lived in it was like the horror

249
00:11:18,069 --> 00:11:25,839
never ended this is the same case for

250
00:11:22,529 --> 00:11:27,910
the Civil War and all the wars conflict

251
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:32,370
trashes that happened since I was born

252
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:35,439
the media leaves when those ends so

253
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:38,110
through my photographs I try to tell the

254
00:11:35,439 --> 00:11:41,050
stories of people who are left behind

255
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:45,730
those whose stories did not specifically

256
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:47,290
interest the mainstream media the issue

257
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:50,709
of the missing and kidnapped

258
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:53,139
haven't been covered much shaky so in my

259
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:55,270
project I wanted to dig deeper in the

260
00:11:53,139 --> 00:11:58,400
story

262
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:07,279
I met Ida and Leda Jada at the tents

263
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:10,670
during a gathering for Odette Fallon who

264
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:13,130
was killed when a car hit her but that

265
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:16,580
was the mother of two young men and his

266
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:21,260
sister her son and her daughter were

267
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:24,170
kidnapped in the 80s the families were

268
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:26,420
all devastated it was yet another mother

269
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:29,920
who had died before receiving any

270
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:33,600

the day of ashura has just allowed us to

273
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:46,580
visit Odette home for a few minutes as I

274
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:48,440
went from one room to another her home

275
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:52,029
looked as if it was untouched for

276
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:55,460
decades inside her daughter's closet

277
00:12:52,029 --> 00:12:58,910
hang a life-sized poster of a male model

278
00:12:55,460 --> 00:13:04,400
on the bottom of the closet next to shoe

279
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:07,010
boxes lay some old dolls and on the wall

280
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:12,050
was hanging a black-and-white poster of

281
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:15,890

282
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:19,040
throw away daily while they have no

283
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:21,230
value for us they act as one of the main

284
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:25,670
evidence for the one-time presence of

285
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:28,310
the missing person the photographs of

286
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:36,830
the belonging gave much more depth to

287
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:39,680
the project three years later in 2012

288
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:41,330
I called Gina to ask her if she and her

289
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:44,339
mother would allow me to take their

290
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:47,529

are left behind those who stories did

318
00:15:08,499 --> 00:15:14,589
not specifically interest the mainstream

319
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:17,109

320
00:15:14,589 --> 00:15:20,709
kidnap haven't been covered much shaky

321
00:15:17,109 --> 00:15:23,919
so in my project I wanted to dig deeper

322
00:15:20,709 --> 00:15:25,809
in the story - to learn more about the

323
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:28,389
different narratives behind the missing

324
00:15:25,809 --> 00:15:30,459
and the kidnapped at the beginning I

325
00:15:28,389 --> 00:15:32,289
photographed for trades for example of

326
00:15:30,459 --> 00:15:32,949
the families then I learned about the

327
00:15:32,289 --> 00:15:34,929
belongings

328
00:15:32,949 --> 00:15:37,359
they kept of the victims with each

329
00:15:34,929 --> 00:15:39,850
family a different story the same pain

330
00:15:37,359 --> 00:15:42,999
of course but a different story and

331
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:44,889
details after a month or two I got in

332
00:15:42,999 --> 00:15:45,809
touch with Benjamin Chesterton from duck

00:15:44,889 --> 00:15:49,209

334
00:15:45,809 --> 00:15:52,920
we emailed back and forth and he was

335
00:15:49,209 --> 00:15:54,900
interested in my way of photography

336
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:56,820
I told him about the project of the

337
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:58,560
missing and Schumer's later he decided

338
00:15:56,820 --> 00:16:04,070
to come together and work with me on

339
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:07,380
that project for the BBC for three days

340
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:09,320
Benjamin and I met mothers of victims of

341
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:15,000
enforced disappearances

342
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:17,850
we met with NGO people MP X militia

343
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,010
members women telling about the last

344
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:23,040
time they saw their children their

345
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:25,170
husbands they talked about their

346
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:28,820
continuous struggle and their only wish

347
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:28,820
to know the fate of their loved ones

348
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:37,250
mostly indicated with the families were

349
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:39,780
conducted in their mother tongue and

350
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:41,930
obviously valya which conducted

351
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:47,160
interviews and I would assist with

352
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:49,290
really helping her to shape them in a

353
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:51,060
sense in that situations its hardest for

354
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:53,100
her because she's got to bring a

355
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:55,920
stranger into a situation is very

356
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:58,260
painful for those women and if you read

357
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:01,110
the interviews that she conducted with

358
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:04,440
them all this contact they talked about

359
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:07,890
each time how the wind is opened up and

360
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:10,770
that is an extremely difficult thing for

361
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:13,880
anybody to do repeatedly in front of

362
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:13,880
journalists or anyone

they were coming back from their work

367
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:44,220
they never heard of them again so along

with a man the mother of my friend I

369
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:48,270

be photographed

371
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:54,870
even after a man interested I looked for

the best place to take the photograph of

373
00:17:54,870 --> 00:18:04,920
Lena there were two chairs that were

374
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:07,710
placed on each side of a small table and

375
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:11,700
on the wall behind them a painting was

hanging HIDA brought a framed portrait

377
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:15,480

in distance Ida's

390
00:18:51,840 --> 00:19:04,080
suddenly sat on the seat and told me to

391
00:18:54,330 --> 00:19:07,320
take the photograph we were all shocked

392
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:09,419
a man Lena and myself she had resisted

393
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:12,629
being photographed for over an hour

394
00:19:09,419 --> 00:19:16,049
while we were having tea earlier so I

395
00:19:12,629 --> 00:19:18,559
just clicked two frames and then her

396
00:19:16,049 --> 00:19:20,669
daughter said for the portrait after her

397
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:23,100
instance what I love about this image is

398
00:19:20,669 --> 00:19:26,960
a huge amount of respect Delhi is not

399
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:31,710
trying she's not trying too hard and

400
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:33,899
it's it's subtle and if poetic who

401
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:35,759
talked about the idea of beauty she does

402
00:19:33,899 --> 00:19:38,090
and it's a beautiful image it took four

403
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:38,090
minutes

404
00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:54,759
so anyway when I developed the films and

405
00:19:52,629 --> 00:19:58,479
scan them I can't hide a photograph to

406
00:19:54,759 --> 00:20:02,909
the jedis by email both of them thought

407
00:19:58,479 --> 00:20:06,639
that the photograph looked very empty a

408
00:20:02,909 --> 00:20:09,039
man and her daughter on the other side

409
00:20:06,639 --> 00:20:12,549
thought it was beautiful and represented

410
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:17,200
her situation and the emptiness in her

411
00:20:12,549 --> 00:20:19,419

412
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,039

00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:27,669

420
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:49,960
by coincidence he was looking at his

00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:54,630
pleasure to be in such a place as a

459
00:22:54,630 --> 00:23:02,640

00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:06,480
what do I need and really that welcome

461
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:09,720
and that trust it's only worth it for

462
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:12,300
them if you do a good job if you tell

463
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:14,460
their story properly it's only worth the

464
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:17,130
pain that they have to go through when

465
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:19,200
they open themselves up if you meet that

466
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:22,110
with a professionalism and a

467
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:24,840

people going back again and again and

478
00:23:58,050 --> 00:24:02,550
again and showing that we care about

479
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:04,800
them and their problem and that we're

480
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:07,590
not only here to photograph them and

481
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:10,470
leave but that we are really trying to

482
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:14,760
make a change and then their cause has

483
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:16,700
become ours this makes people open up

484
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:19,200
and trust us and let us into their life

485
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:21,660
the family sent the stories of the

486
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:24,450
missing loved ones they show their

487
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:27,480
belongings that they had guarded for

488
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:29,280
decades they share all the scales and

489
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:32,730
evidence they had collected throughout

490
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:35,280
the years I had understood the value of

491
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:40,200
those belongings and photograph them as

492
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:42,180
precious relics each item alone I was

493
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:44,370
thinking about what I wanted to say

494
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:47,790
particularly in relation to you and the

495
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:51,120
audience looking at a photo and how you

496
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:53,190
might respond to that firstly and the

497
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:56,669
thing that I wanted to tell you was that

498
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:59,190
the danger of a photo is that a whole

499
00:24:56,669 --> 00:25:02,909
someone in time in moment it kind of

500
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:04,710
says this is this is it right and life

501
00:25:02,909 --> 00:25:08,249
is not like that because it's much more

502
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:10,139
complex and sometimes we need earlier to

503
00:25:08,249 --> 00:25:12,749
have sat down with the women and just

504
00:25:10,139 --> 00:25:14,309
hear what they think and it kind of

505
00:25:12,749 --> 00:25:16,440
takes away a lot of the formality of

506
00:25:14,309 --> 00:25:19,710
what you're seeing and your feelings

507
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:21,690
about what you're seeing in fact what I

508
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:24,059
would say is her interview with the

509
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:26,549
women in many ways is actually more

510
00:25:24,059 --> 00:25:29,669
humanizing than the photograph itself

511
00:25:26,549 --> 00:25:39,720
and that's something really interesting

512
00:25:29,669 --> 00:25:41,700
to reflect on there is a violence in

513
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:43,590
photography that on one level perhaps

514
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:45,600
violence is the wrong word but there's a

515
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:47,070
tension when a person brings a camera or

516
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:49,200
a smartphone up to their eye there's

517
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:50,879
immediately the photographer and the

518
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,619
photographed and there will be the

519
00:25:50,879 --> 00:25:54,809
audience or the viewer as well at some

520
00:25:52,619 --> 00:25:56,489
point and the most powerful stakeholder

521
00:25:54,809 --> 00:26:00,480
in those three-way relationships is

522
00:25:56,489 --> 00:26:02,070
almost never the subject is why this

523
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,539
class interview the setup the way they

524
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:05,940
are between the photographer our

525
00:26:03,539 --> 00:26:08,279
subjects and the audience is to explore

526
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:09,869
that tension and then it for us to

527
00:26:08,279 --> 00:26:11,369
reflect on our relationships with the

528
00:26:09,869 --> 00:26:13,200
world we'll bring the camera up to our

529
00:26:11,369 --> 00:26:15,749
eye and make the world our subject and

530
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:17,239
listen to dahlias conversation one of

531
00:26:15,749 --> 00:26:19,230
the first things that's apparent is that

532
00:26:17,239 --> 00:26:21,600
telling someone else's story is a

533
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:23,309
speculative endeavor right I mean Dahlia

534
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,809
and Benjamin asked permission of their

535
00:26:23,309 --> 00:26:27,289
subjects in the full knowledge that they

536
00:26:24,809 --> 00:26:29,429
might well and do sometimes say no

537
00:26:27,289 --> 00:26:31,289
Dahlia talk to people agreeing to have

538
00:26:29,429 --> 00:26:33,119
their photographs made years after she

539
00:26:31,289 --> 00:26:34,499
asked and we begin to get a sense of the

540
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:36,450
negotiation that has to take place

541
00:26:34,499 --> 00:26:37,799
between the subject and the photographer

542
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:40,109
and the importance of trust in that

543
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:42,690
relationship I said in the introduction

544
00:26:40,109 --> 00:26:45,029
that what Dolly's work will come to mean

545
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:47,070
is interesting but that applies to all

546
00:26:45,029 --> 00:26:48,480
our images it's difficult if not

547
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:50,159
impossible for us to know what our

548
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,559
images will come to mean in future

549
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:55,710
contexts what their values might be and

550
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:57,299
to whom which is problematic when we've

551
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:59,669
negotiated or built a trust relationship

552
00:26:57,299 --> 00:27:01,230
with our subjects I mean what is it that

553
00:26:59,669 --> 00:27:03,149
we promised what is their understanding

554
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:07,019
and what exactly do they give their

555
00:27:03,149 --> 00:27:09,239
consent for the subject has to agree to

556
00:27:07,019 --> 00:27:10,999
be vulnerable and not just once not just
