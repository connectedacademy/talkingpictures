  When everyone has the means to make and publish photographic images, what
  makes some stories more believable than others? What makes some photographers
  more believable than others? Welcome to the first instalment of **Talking
  Pictures**, a new kind of photography course where photographers, their
  subjects and audiences come together. This week sees Lebanese photographer
  Dalia Khamissy re-united with some of the subjects from her long-term project
  on the families of people ‘forcibly-disappeared’ during the country’s civil
  war.

We’re used to photographs being evidential. The first hundred years of photography’s history established its reputation as trace representation, a quotation from appearances **link to ritchin’s after photography**. It was something that required a human to make, but once the shutter was released, the moment was captured and locked within an independent chemical process. Even still, it represented a point of view, both literally and figuratively. Digital photography does enable us to make a lot more photographs, quicker and cheaper, but we still have to choose how to edit the world, in order to tell our story clearly. We discern between important visual information and extraneous visual noise and we have to do this within messy, chaotic and often very personal situations.

In this session we hear from Dalia Khamissy and subjects from her project; “The Missing”. We hear how she tells the stories of people, through their homes, their possessions and their relatives. We hear from those relatives what the process of sharing their stories is like for them, and we hear film-maker Benjamin Chesterton describe the responsibilities of the professional storyteller as well as suggestions for what we, as audience, might reflect on.

All of us are the audience today, many of us will also think of ourselves as photographers and some of us will understand what it is to be a subject. As we listen to the audio piece consider how each person’s motivation is reflected. Is the historical account an unbiased one? What is Dalia’s motivation and how have her outlets for that motivation evolved? What is the motivation of the subjects, why do they agree to submit to such a painful procedure? And what does Benjamin hope to achieve? What or who is the common ground that these various stakeholders share? In a world where every person in this piece can publish their own story and make their own photographs, what are the various roles of the 21st century photographer?
