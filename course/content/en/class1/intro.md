# Week 1 - Evidence

How do we as photographers tell the story of a subject that is missing? How might one tell the story of loss, of the deceased, the invisible?

How might these images constitute or inform a body of evidence?

How might they and we, be believed?

What role does trust have, and how do we as storytellers gain that trust and imbue our work with it?
