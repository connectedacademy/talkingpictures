  When everyone has the means to make and publish photographic images, what
  makes some stories more believable than others? What makes some photographers
  more believable than others? Welcome to The World Press Photo Foundation's
  **Talking Pictures**, a new kind of photography course where photographers,
  their subjects and audiences come together and invite you to join the
  conversation. This week sees Lebanese photographer Dalia Khamissy re-united
  with some of the subjects from her long-term project on the families of people
  ‘forcibly-disappeared’ during the country’s civil war. @[bio](Dalia Khamissy

## Evidence - Introduction

We’re used to photographs being evidential. The first hundred years of photography’s history established its reputation as trace representation, a quotation from appearances. It was something that required a human to make, but once the shutter was released, the process became chemical. Even still, the photograph represents a point of view, both literally and figuratively, we still have to choose how to edit the world. We discern between important visual information and extraneous visual noise and we have to do this within messy, chaotic and often very personal situations.

In this session we hear from **Dalia Khamissy** and subjects from her project; **“The Missing”**. We hear how she tells the stories of people, through their homes, their possessions and their relatives. We hear from those relatives what the process of sharing their stories is like for them, and we hear film-maker Benjamin Chesterton describe the responsibilities of the professional storyteller as well as suggestions for what we, as audience, might reflect on.

As we, the audience, listen, we should reflect on what moves us and interrogate why? How can photographs of absence retain an evidential currency? What case is being built? What is the overall narrative? Is the historical account an unbiased one? What is Dalia’s motivation and how have her outlets for that motivation evolved? What is the motivation of the subjects? Why do they agree to submit to such a painful procedure? And what does Benjamin hope to achieve? What or who is the common-ground for these various stakeholders? In a world where everyone in this piece can theoretically publish their own story, what are the various roles of Dalia and the 21st century photographer?

Other questions will appear in the transcript and you will have your own, please add them, your answers, your comments and your notes into the platform as you listen.
