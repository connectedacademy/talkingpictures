title: FourCorners Intro
description: >-
  The information surrounding a photograph will change the way it is
  interpreted. Context creates meaning. <INSERT MEME EXAMPLE> Four Corners is an
  authoring tool for photographers. It enables the photographer to add extra
  information into an image so that they are no longer reliant on the
  surrounding information to convey their intended meaning. It is central to
  Talking Pictures because it enables the reader to interrogate the photograph
  and better understand the motivation, perspective and values of the
  photographer.
