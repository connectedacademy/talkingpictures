In the spring of 1989, more than one million Chinese students and workers occupied Beijing's Tiananmen Square and began the largest political protest in communist China's history. Six weeks of protests ended with the Beijing massacre of 3-4 June.","author":"Charlie Cole","publication":"World Press Photo","publicationUrl":"https://www.worldpressphoto.org/collection/photo/1990/world-press-photo-year/charlie-cole","date":"5/6/1989"},"creativeCommons":{"credit":"Charlie Cole","year":"1989","copyright":"All rights reserved","codeOfEthics":"Photojournalist","description":"A demonstrator confronts a line of People's Liberation Army tanks on Chang'an Avenue, Beijing, during protests for democratic reform on Tianganmen Square."}}
