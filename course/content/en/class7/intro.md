  When everyone has the means to make and publish photographic images, what
  makes some stories more believable than others? What makes some photographers
  more believable than others? Welcome to the first instalment of **Talking
  Pictures**, a new kind of photography course where photographers, their
  subjects and audiences come together. This week sees Lebanese photographer
  Dalia Khamissy re-united with some of the subjects from her long-term project
  on the families of people ‘forcibly-disappeared’ during the country’s civil
  war. @[bio](Dalia Khamissy
