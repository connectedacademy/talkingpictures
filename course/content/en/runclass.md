If you’d like to run a class of your own at your school/university or within your community, then you can access all of the course materials via the platform. Content goes live according to the schedule <linked> and online participants can then access the content and join the connected conversation in their most convenient a time zone.
 
Be sure to register your class in the correct time-zone in order for us to map where and when it is running!
 
The Connected Academy Platform organises content like a playlist. The participant can then choose to listen to the bare minimum or do the deeper-dives. The staged conversations are in fact audio-montages edited from 3 or 4 different interviews. The full versions can be accessed via the playlist, as well as a series of podcasts by photographers who address the course questions directly.  As a registered teacher you will have access to, and should listen to, all of the content prior to the launch day. As a teacher you should also feel confident adapting that content to better cater to your participant’s needs by, for example, creating your own playlists or augmenting the materials with your own.
 
In order for your class to benefit from the connected conversation they will have to tweet their notes and comments throughout. The Connected Academy Platform enables participants to see the networked conversation. It visualises hot-spots in the materials where reaction and conversation are most lively, and the pause, scrub-back/scrub-forward options allow the participant to dig around in and around there.
 
The classes have four phases, phase one the participant is invited to produce photographic response to a provocation, for example lesson 1: “Tell me the story of something that isn’t there”
Phase two is where the participant gets access to the class content and is directed to make notes and comments via the Connected Academy Platform.
Phase three is review, reflection and discussion.
Phase four is a revisiting of the initial photographic response (with the benefit of both the class session, its deep-dive content and the networked class community) and sharing the updated or new version.  <this might be better as a diagram?>
