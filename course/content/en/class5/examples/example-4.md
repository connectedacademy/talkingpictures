Around 15,000 people work in the area, in pits hacked into the ground, some barely wider than a manhole. As the price of gold fell, people began to dig ever deeper to find enough to make a daily wage. Arzuma works some 20 meters underground. Mining under these conditions is backbreaking labor during which miners are constantly breathing in dust. The subsequent process of extracting the gold exposes them to mercury and cyanide.","author":"Matjaz Krivic","publication":"World Press Photo","publicationUrl":"https://www.worldpressphoto.org/collection/photo/2016/people/matjaz-krivic","date":"November 20, 2015"},"creativeCommons":{"credit":"Matjaz Krivic","year":"2015","copyright":"All rights reserved","codeOfEthics":"Photojournalist","description":"Arzuma Tinado (28) leads an eight-member crew of miners at Djuga, an artisanal gold mine in north-eastern Burkina Faso."}}
