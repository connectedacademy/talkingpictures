The warehouse, owned by Ruhai Logistics, was registered for storage of hazardous chemicals. Safety regulations stipulating that public buildings should be at least one kilometer away were not heeded. A series of explosions at the facility resulted in damage to some 17,000 residences and 8,000 vehicles, killing over 170 people (95 of them firefighters) and injuring hundreds more. Later investigation concluded that the first explosion occurred in an overheated container of dry nitrocellulose, which set off further explosions, including one that involved the detonation of around 800 tons of ammonium nitrate.","author":"Chen Jie","publication":"Beijing News","publicationUrl":"https://www.worldpressphoto.org/collection/photo/2016/general-news/chen-jie","date":"August 15, 2015"},"creativeCommons":{"credit":"Chen Jie","year":"2015","copyright":"All rights reserved","codeOfEthics":"Photojournalist","description":"A large pit, wrecked vehicles and damaged buildings remain in the aftermath of explosions in the container storage station of a logistics company in the Port of Tianjin, northeastern China."}}
